# neume-network/data

- We crawl all of zora (catalog.works, sound.xyz daily through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/neume-network/data/actions). 
- You can set up your own crawl with [neume-network/core](https://github.com/neume-network/core)
- But feel free to use the final data set: [results/music-os-accumulator-extraction](https://github.com/neume-network/data/blob/main/results/music-os-accumulator-extraction).

## Working releases

Not all commits in neume-network/core work flawlesly in production. But some do and this is confirmed by e.g. a branch's top commit passing the entire crawl suite. Below are a number of tree states in neume-network/core that pass the entire crawling suite.
