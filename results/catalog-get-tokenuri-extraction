In particular, I love how both artists use a combination of space, simplicity, and distortion in their instrumental storytelling. I also find beauty in sharply contrasted sections of melodic vs. atonal elements. Add in some dub vocal samples and we're in business. \r\n\r\nYou'll find the first half to be a more sparse stroll, whereas the second half has a rushed timewarp feel. \r\n\r\nThis is the sixth song on my album Last Chance At Life. Each song is part of a larger story in which three friends leave a ravaged Earth behind in search of a new planet. \r\n\r\nOn 'Requiem' one of the members of the crew, Omar, stumbles across the remains of his grandfather while exploring through a cave. Omar's grandfather had mysteriously vanished years before after claiming to have discovered a new planet. \r\n\r\nNo one in his family had ever really believed in his mission besides Omar, so the discovery of his bones was both redeeming and heart-wrenching. \r\n\r\nTo read the full story, go here: https://www.houndtrack.com/last-chance-at-life\r\n\r\nEach song on the Last Chance At Life album has its own artwork created by Leonardo Silva (@itwasleo on socials) and mastered by Lukas Turza of Snap Mastering.","duration":181.185,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x17c72771bb6b283bade0c07e0901744c37ff8c41/requiem-1650481000","image":"ipfs://bafybeic7hruy3u3qwssggdl6xhgt5szrrzncbbv7337v6pwtrqx7x5h76a","losslessAudio":"ipfs://bafybeihi7dkqgexhoksndfxu4x5yl2a36kq7i3acfyo5pn37mqxjzlgotm","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"HOUNDTRACK - Requiem","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://bafybeic7hruy3u3qwssggdl6xhgt5szrrzncbbv7337v6pwtrqx7x5h76a","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Last Chance At Life","description":"Earth is being ravaged by humans' destruction.

It was a time in my life where everyday was a struggle just to make ends meet. I used to drive a car that would randomly cut off on the interstate. I mean like literally cut off and I would have to pray it would crank back up while doing about 80 mph (crazy I know). But even during those trying times I never let it get the best of me. I knew I was destined for something better and that those trials and tribulations were just preparation. \r\n\r\nI'm a firm believer in the law of attraction. I used to lived a fast life filled with negativity that often made me think in the same manner as my environment. When I realized that I could change my life by changing my mindset, life changed for me.

I was at a friends BBQ trying to convince them to give Ableton Live a shot instead of using FL Studio.  They were very resistant to change and wanted no part in learning a new DAW haha.  After a few hours of repeatedly asking, I was finally able to get him to sit down and let me show him how fast my work flow was compared to FL Studio.  The pre-warping step is where every person i've taught Ableton to gets frustrated.  When you are dealing with Jazz, classical or any form of music that isn't quantized or that changes time signatures,  it extends the amount of time it takes to properly warp the sample.  Everyone has different methods for this, for me personally.  I create a new clip at each new time signature change.  It's a lot of prep work so this is where I usually lose people that are used to just manually chopping records quickly.  Especially since I take the time to always do the entire song instead of just \"the dope parts\".  The Warp and Auto-chop feature allows me to turn a sample into a instrument.  Having each note at my disposal.  I also take extra steps like tapping the tempo,  half timing the sample.  Then Re-sampling at the slower tempo.  Freezing it.  bringing the tempo back to its normal bpm, then once again resampling it so I can chop it and retain the more stretched out version.  Which is a lengthy process but one I feel is worth it for what i'm trying to achieve.  Then i'll Autochop multiple instances to different samplers.  Some at 1/4 notes,  some at 1/8 notes,  1/2 notes etc..       Sounds like it's more complicated than it is, but after repetition,  this process goes by pretty quickly.  So after I showed him all the steps,  He was beginning to get frustrated and didn't want to keep learning. At this point,  I didn't even have any drums loaded up and he was becoming super Antsy.  I didn't want him to walk away before I showed him why I took the time to do all that. So I pressed record,  and blindly laid some chops in one quick take.  No metronome, no grid.  Because I took time to do all the prep work,  I was confident any chop I chose would perfectly land on beat. People are usually hesitant to sample songs with loud drums and try to chop around them, but I usually can mask any loud drums by using ghost kicks and sidechain compression. Since I had no drums loaded up or any effects.  I knew the drums in the sample would be present in all my chops, so I used them as my compass and thus,  \"NoUse\" for was born. He hated the beat and to this day he still uses FL Studio haha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":126.407,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/nouse-1655854727","image":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmSkz9MVUVt7qxs68WxMREAEK3omEoyunJ6jkteGcgjVDD","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - NoUse","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Traversal","description":"\"NoUse\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]"},"title":"NoUse","trackNumber":20,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

So it was the first track created for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/chill-gawd-chill\r\n\r\nBackstory: \r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa.   It sold out immediately and was bandcamp's best selling Cassette.   Due to high demand and fomo,  I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016,  Once again it sold out immediately and was bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row.   Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable.  To this Day,  \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp.  In fall of 2020,  I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa.   It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette.  The problem was,  I pulled 4 songs what was supposed to be my follow up album \"The Uproot\" and placed them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" last minute.  Those songs were \"Evolution of a shrug\" / \"The Scramble\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" (feat. Ash Tre Jinkins & Sleepy Eyes) and removed a few songs that were created specifically for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"   this decision derailed the release of \"The Uproot\" and it still remains officially unreleased to this day.  Instead I released \"Traversal\" next,  which is actually the follow up album to the \"The Uproot\".  (confusing huh?)  \r\n\r\nCollecting this,  you will receive a copy of rare / sold out final pressing of \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" + Nag Champa (which will ship in June with all the other orders)  It will also Unlock me minting the title track \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" which if collected, will finally unlock this from being gated to bandcamp only.   I will finally end my protest and upload \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to all streaming services. \r\n\r\n*****Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****\r\n\r\nThe most valuable wisdom I can offer to anyone, is \"Just Be Yourself\".

I see too many thoughts daily, So I shifted my creative energy into expression without words. beats, keys, sample manipulation, experimenting with creating new worlds from nothing, or evolving a sample into the unrecognizable just music in general, just speaking without using words.\r\n\r\nHip Hop stopped inspiring or surprising me, with minimal exceptions. The fun aspect of being an emcee or making music kind of fell out of style. where up until about 2011, it was everywhere, so accessible. such a vibe, easy to bounce that creative energy back into the world.\r\n\r\nbut I still am an emcee, passionate, over talkative, TMI, super expressive human IRL.\r\n\r\nbut losing chronologic timelines on social media (yep i'm going there again) really changed how humans communicate online. Expansive conversations don't happen by design, everything is fragmented, and anything long form is taboo, especially using your words to communicate on these apps. you see a paragraph, you think rant. Crazy right? I'm the crazy one? nah this new fragmented, A.I. manipulated timeline we all living in doesn't want nor allow for expansive dialog to happen in real time anymore. Everyone's on a soap box, trapped, reacting, and dunking basically always in offense or defense mode. hahaha I grew tired of battle rap in the early 2000's, now soccer moms, senators and the whole worlds has battle rap energy haha.\r\n\r\nYou think this discouraged me, nah. I let that lil light shine in private haha, I missed when hip-hop was fun, so i had fun with hip-hop in private, got all my venting out and recorded it every time. Freestyling and flipping samples is all do, while rebelling publicly, hoarding insane amounts of beats, and albums, i got super addicted to recording everything in real time.. The rawest and truest form of expression.... having fun, being introspective on autopilot.\r\n\r\nAbsolute freedom.\r\n\r\nbut this stuff was never intended to be heard by anyone. DailyRambles is me loading up a batch of beats on the Tascam DR-05 that i haven't listened to yet, and blindly freestyling and seeing which ones move me enough to make me wanna sit and write, and having fun with the ones that don't fit my voice or style and have fun trying to make it work.\r\n\r\nI had zero intentions to make any of these freestyles public,  but due to severe health complications, I might not always be here and even if I am able to somehow course correct by pure miracle and insane amounts of debt,  it would alter my ability to speak the same and/or articulate the way I do now. \r\n\r\nThere may never be another well thought out, written and recorded \"Dutchmassive\" album in the future. But there is 6 years worth of \"DailyRambles\" right now.\r\nI'm reluctant about even dropping this as Dutchmassive, even though polls on all \"social media\" unanimously chose it over the alias \"Reluctant Clap\"\r\n\r\nI won't always be here. I'd rather this silly introspective gibberish be out in the world, then locked away on my hard drive.\r\n\r\n********Collecting this, will Unlock a new Artist profile on Catalog Works. \"Dutchmassive\" where I will release freestyles from the Reluctant Clap / Daily Rambles series as well as songs from my official albums known as the emcee Dutchmassive.

Being on the mountain in nature, isolated and having space to walk outside without running into strangers at every step was a much needed change of pace.   I blossomed isolated surrounded by so much natural beauty untouched by man mad hands. Towards the end of my stay,  Early 2015, my friend reached out to me and asked me if I would play a show in Brooklyn.  As much as i loved playing music for people.  NY city is the polar opposite of a secluded Nature Preserve,  and after a year in isolation, the thought of taking trains and subways gave me a panic attack which I wasn't expecting.  I thought I healed and was past all that.  So I declined.  He would not take no for an answer, and I didn't like the fact that I had gained a fear of doing such a normal thing like traveling into the city,  something I've done a million times before so I caved and agreed to do the show.   I took a train to union station, and I remember  walking up those stairs and stepping out into the city and there were literal Tanks lined up, cops everywhere and more people than I had seen in years.  I felt like a time traveler out of place, spooked by loud noises and anxiously tried to find directions to get to Brooklyn.  When I finally arrived at the apartment my friend was staying at.  I told myself, I never walking out of the door haha.  My friend DJ introduced me to his friend and our host Brian, and we immediately started talking about music.  He asked what I used to create and told him Ableton Live.  He said he always wanted to learn Ableton, so without hesitation I said,  \"well class in session, I'm going to teach you right now\"  he asked if I was hungry,  I said \"I'm too anxious to eat at the moment, but we can reward ourselves with sustenance after we get a quick session in\" .  I pulled out my laptop,  let him pick a sample and showed him my process.  You know,  all the boring set up stuff that happens before you're able to properly execute ideas.  In Typical Dutch fashion,  I got tunnel vision but had anxiety, knowing I would eventually have to walk out the door and go out in public. So I channeled that energy and imagined an escape route,  bypassing all the crowds of strangers and my mind wondered to thoughts of climbing down a latter that leads to a submarine that could just go under the city instead of through it to get back to the mountain and thus, \"Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn\" was born.  You can hear me working through my emotions trying to find a peaceful resolve and reaching conflict in the middle, but in the end I make it peacefully to the surface.  I personally like the Cassette version of this song more (Dynamics Crushed, but a little more punchy) but I don't think most people would be able to tell the difference and this was the original export.\r\n\r\nP.S.  I was fine for the rest of the trip.  Played a dope house set,  said my goodbyes and took the train back to the nature preserve.  This remains one of my favorite tracks of the thousands I've made over the years.  Music is a form a meditation.  It's saved my life, more times than I can count, quite literally...  but we will save that backstory for another time.  \r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":240.048,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/sub-marine-underbrooklyn-1655055284","image":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPFNTxVTY7hFitiKp5M4z9DFTc1Wrc2m4ic4soyoNizMV","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Traversal","description":"Traversal (Digital Version) - Track 15 - \"Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]"},"title":"Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn","trackNumber":15,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

I love a challenge and I wasn't busy, so I immediately agreed to the challenge and said I would have it posted to Soundcloud later that night.  I ended up choosing the sample used in Smif & Wessun's classic single \"Buck Town\".  I quickly programed a kick & a snare, then began chopping.   A few hours later it was uploaded to the Soundcloud.  The original version was a bit slower, had a few more chop change up's and only a kick and snare.  A few days later,  I was speaking with Chester Watson about my upcoming Cassette while we were swapping songs back and forth just showing each other unreleased & new music. The next day he sent me back the version you hear now.  Slightly sped up,  added some filler drums and a bassline that melts your face along with any decent system it's played on.  I added a intro,  and decided to place it on my upcoming cassette \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and thus \"Turning Point\" was born and the original version was deleted from Soundcloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa.   It sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling Cassette.   Due to high demand and fomo,  I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016. Once again, it sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row.   Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable.  To this Day,  \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp.  In fall of 2020,  I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa.   It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette.  The problem was,  I pulled 4 songs fromwhat was supposed to be my follow up album \"The Uproot\" and placed them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" last minute.  Those songs were \"Evolution of a shrug\" / \"The Scramble\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" (feat. ashtrejinkins & sleepyeyes) and removed a few songs that were created specifically for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"   this decision derailed the release of \"The Uproot\" which it still remains officially unreleased to this day.  Instead I released \"Traversal\" next,  which is actually the follow up album to the \"The Uproot\".

Whom, like myself, always felt at peace at night when the world was quiet and still.  Happy Mother Day.  \r\n\r\nTrack list:\r\n1.) Nocturnalis I [00:00]\r\n2.) Nocturnalis II [02:21]\r\n3.) Nocturnalis III [06:02]\r\n4.) Debbie. [08:39] \r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\n   I was living in Los Angeles when my mother Debbie got sick in August of 2016.  She was the text case of a hypochondriac so when she told me,  I basically told her to walk it off in a nice motivational way.  A few days passed and she was admitted to the hospital.  My family all told me the Doctors said she would be fine.  At the time,  I just started a job doing master QC for Netflix.  I was on a probationary period,  living on my friend Josh's couch ( Sunjet /Josh Jetson ) and didn't even have enough money to get back and forth to work yet,  so my mom would PayPal the little money she had to help. A few days passed and mom had to be intubated. Obviously things were more serious than my family led them to be.  My heart was heavy.  I just started this amazing job making $120 hour and all I wanted was to fly home and see my mother,  but my family insisted I focus on the Job my mom was so proud I landed and that it was in my best interest not to see her like this and that the doctors said she will be fine. 2 days later,  My probationary period ended and I finally started getting paid.   I was at work trying to keep my calm & stay positive by listening to Bobby_Hutcherson's \"Nocturnal\" on repeat. My phone abruptly rang and when i picked up  my brother was crying his eyes out.   My heart dropped, He couldn't form many words so He put me on the phone with the doctor. They wanted my permission to take her off life support. At this point, I'm shell-shocked because the last time I spoke with my family, they down played how serious her condition was. The doctor passed the phone to someone specialized in breaking this type of news to people and she tried her hardest to comfort me and advise me that taking her off life support was the best option and what the rest of family already had came to terms with, but i refused..  My mother was full of love and empathy,  she felt this world too deeply and it was difficult for her. As much as she loved us,  she always had a hard time navigating thru this world (The same goes for myself and my brother,  we feel things deeply and always feel out of place).   I was listening to  \"Nocturnal\"  when i got the phone call my mother wasn't going to make it. A song once used to help calm and center me now had this traumatic energy attached to it.  I told my job what was happening and they told me to take a few days off to process.  The next day,  I got an email from my Job saying do not come into work before calling.  Apparently,  it was against policy to take pictures in the building, and I had posted a picture of me at my desk on twitter when i got 1st got hired saying verbatim - \"thank you universe for 2nd chances,  I am eternally grateful\"  - With regret in their voice,  they had to terminate me immediately.  It was a zero tolerance policy.  My boss was crying telling me this, because they grew fond on me my short time with them and I was very very good at my job, plus they knew what I was dealing with, but it was flagged by someone very high up in the chain and no exceptions could be made.  My heart was smashed, I worked so hard to get that job and my mother and family were so proud of me.  I didn't know how to break the news to them.  I just kind of fell to pieces, paralyzed in the motel room I was in.  40 minutes later I got the call.   My mother had passed.  August 19, 2016.      I was on the next flight back to Tampa Bay to help take care of my family and became super numb.  After the celebration of life, I needed to express and grieve in my own way. So the first time i touched music since she passed,  I decided to flip the bobby_hutch sample.   I did it very fast,  didn't overthink or mix it down,  just quickly flipped the sample  uploaded it to soundcloud titled \"I will delete this\" (which i didn't, just changed the track name to \"...\".  The following year on mothers day 2017,  I revisited the o.g. sample and made 2 more flips dedicated to her.  Nocturnalis I, II  and I also recorded a freestyle over one of them (that didn't make it to the ep).  One year later on mothers day 2018,  I revisited it one last time and created Nocturnalis I.\r\n   I haven't ever truly recovered from losing my mother.  My big heart crew cold. The defensive walls I built after such a traumatic experience have never really went away to this day.  I've never officially dropped an album since, like I'm protesting Finality.  The crazy thing is, I've made more music from 2017-present,  then I made from 1995-2016.  Multiple unreleased albums,  changed my entire creative process as therapy and began evolving portals and never stopped.   I hope one day to feel light and at peace again, and I hope where ever you are mom.  You are finally at peace. \r\n\r\nDebbie (May 1st, 1953 - August 19th 2016)\r\n\r\nI love you and miss you so much, you always loved my spacey, sleepy, mellow music, so I know you would sleep to these on repeat. \r\n\r\nEternally....Your Son, Dutch.\r\n  \r\n\r\n ***** I was going to upload this on my mothers birthday, but decided I would wait until mothers day to keep it more consistent with when most of the tracks were created.  I'm not sure if this EP will resonate or be collected anytime soon, but i wanted to pay tribute to my biggest supporter. Once this does get collected. I will revisit the original project file and create \"Nocturalis IV\" and I will contact the person who collects the EP, and mint it for basically the cost of gas so they/you can not only be the first to hear, but also collect it.\r\n\r\n****Collector will receive access to mymaster vault cloud drive titled \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\", with over 110gbs of nearly the full released discography, (1996-future).  Multiple unreleased albums and WIP,  Portals / Evolving Portals (real time sessions, making music from start to end, with the intention of resampling that session in the future and continuously evolving it), side projects, as well as videos posted to my instagram, youtube, and previous twitch vods.  This drive is constantly being updated/added to which will never stop happening.****\r\n\r\n\r\nSidenote: \r\nI used to fight with my mother constantly about engaging on my music posts on facebook with personal stuff.  I was pretty mean about it, and it wasn't until after she passed I found out she created a secret tumblr account ( https://hopefulninja.tumblr.com/ ) so she could keep up with what I was doing and show love.  I cried pretty hard when i found it, cus she just wanted to support me and I was too worried about supporters/fans, seeing a bunch of personal stuff or stalking her page. I had no idea she was on tumblr. I just teared up looking at that page again haha. Fast forward to 2022,  The entire social media space is ruled by engagement, sometimes i feel like karma is haunting me on twitter when i post all this art i'm proud of with nearly 3k followers, and maybe 4 people consistently show up (if they see it) You really don't know what you have til it's gone.  Cherish your loved ones.\r\n\r\nPeacePeace. <3","duration":710.426,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-mother-nocturalis-ep-1652052419","image":"ipfs://bafkreiht2sfhoqojz5bizge6ut6je4n3d2wa54tbcfasvich6kcwy2d5xm","losslessAudio":"ipfs://bafybeiazhyknt75tqgzqhbiphqkiardm5am7e5tlleb5w36qzsixjf6kuy","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"Mother\" (Nocturalis) EP","title":"\"Mother\" (Nocturalis) EP","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

My pops who had had not had contact with in over decade saw that I was in NY and invited me to visit him for the weekend in upstate NY.  Reluctantly,  I accepted. I was surprised to learn my father had become the caretaker of the Nature Preserve \"Sam's Point Reserve\" in Craigsmoor NY.   After reconnecting as adults,  we caught up, hashed out previous issues and bonded instantly,  swapping music and stories.  I ended up deciding to stay on the mountain with my pops.  The Nature Preserve was massive, open to public from 8-4pm then after that the whole place was mine to explore.  Coming from Los Angeles where I was overwhelmed with over population, cliche's, politics, trend chasing, etc.  being on a secluded mountain with access to waterfalls, ice caves, etc was just the medicine I needed.  I dropped the 2 HR Cassette \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" which sold out immediately, and Began working on my opus, A return to the spirit of Nature,  \"The Uproot\" & \"Traversal\" were born.  I created so much music I had to split the release into separate albums.    \r\n\"where are we headed\" was created in a way where it doesn't even sound real, but I promise you it is.   One night on a full moon,  I took my laptop and blue tooth speaker to the big open field surrounded by the mountain and set up on a trailer bed.  I thought of how the music scene was shifting from beat scene to dance / future bass and how all my favorite producers stopped sounding like themselves chasing trends and then i channeled that energy under the Full Moon and blacked out getting lost in creation,  when I finally looked up from the blinding laptop screen,  I saw I was surrounded by like 40 pairs of glowing eyes,  I was terrified,  until I turned the flashlight on to find out that I had Pied piper a parcel of Deer.   They where all sitting and surrounding me watching me and listening to this song being created.

I had just inherited a painting by Gino Hollander, a painting that I had grown up with and loved dearly. I placed this painting in front of me at my studio, and before I could think, a series of soft eighth notes escaped my fingers. I spent the following 3 months turning that initial idea into the piece it is today. This is my genesis NFT as well as my first true example of art music, as the majority of my compositions have only danced around the idea. This concept of art music, and its origin within the concept of ekphrasis, is one that I’ve been gripped by... I personally find nothing more rewarding then to seek out meaning within the story, and transliterate that into music. So, this piece, Desiderium, after Gino Hollander’s 1994 ‘Untitled’, is the story that I hear. I hope it touches you.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Elliot Cole [elliotcole.eth], for the guidance within this burgeoning space and for making my genesis drop on Catalog a reality, as well as Siri Hollander, for granting permission to use images of her late father’s work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDS USED\r\n\r\nVioloncello I: Niles Luther\r\nVioloncello II: Niles Luther\r\n\r\nPiano I: Spitfire Audio [Olafur Arnalds Felt Grand Piano]\r\nPiano II: Signature Sam Samples [Signature Grand]\r\n\r\nOrchestra: Spitfire Audio [Appassionata Strings]\r\n\r\n808: FutureAudioWorkshop [SubLab]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING DETAILS\r\n\r\nTitle: Untitled\r\nArtist: Gino Hollander\r\nMedium: Oil on Canvas\r\nYear of Work: 1994\r\nSize: 48 x 48 in","duration":493.416,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x76f634ec8366bdbc8ed1a050afc3b9b9324d5f26/desiderium-1655920189","image":"ipfs://QmUiYRnvwxQS5sG32FRf5qJG3rzSJwrR9h2vNbeKVmjrAt","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPnFoWDNAYJgMeo7mV4QuCRYSigm2ezN5LFCitFMPA13q","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Niles Luther - Desiderium","title":"Desiderium","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Included in the primary auction is a custom merchandise package and two tickets to any Dot show (festivals excluded). \r\n\r\n50% of profits from the \"Early Days\" series will also be donated to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court leaked draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights. \r\n\r\nWith love and compassion,\r\n\r\nDot","duration":243.278,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/super-moon-1652470060","image":"ipfs://bafkreictacy43lz6ftnxsjpn5tzoasw2guaa6avgns4otuvrotolb633ia","losslessAudio":"ipfs://bafybeiev4dtew5s6wwalfnhzhtta465owhbrmjrmuxa5ybihkhj4k6e4wi","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Super Moon","title":"Super Moon","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

The album's creative life span started as early as 2013 while still living in my first apartment in Los Angeles.  The creation of \"Traversal\" would run parallel to the creation of \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and more significantly, \"The Uproot\".  Spanning multiple states and multiple environments / situations that all inspired these sessions in very different but equally profound ways.  After leaving Los Angeles abruptly in early 2014, I jettisoned back to Tampa, FL to be met with extreme heartbreak and disappointment, quickly reminding me when I moved away in the first place.  Fate would extend it's hand in the form of a long time fan & friend of a lot of rappers in my immediate & extended family tree (Demigodz, AOTP,  etc) reaching out and offering an escape hatch to NY to get off the couch I was surfing on in Tampa and come stay a few months in #Yetiville where I would have my own room and access to a studio upstairs. The condition was that I have to write & record a song for his album/mixtape. \r\n\r\nhttps://samthesleezbag.bandcamp.com/album/sleezbagmekalektape\r\n\r\n I agreed and was on a plane to NY a few days later.  It was dope living in this multi-story 5 bedroom house on hill surrounded and secluded by trees (Lord Digga named that house Yetiville because it was hidden and only accessible by a long narrow dirt road)  Keep in mind, at this point (spring/summer 2014) I had not released an album as Dutchmassive since 2008.  I was not rapping,  I was in my producer bag and that bag wasn't always typical boom-bap beats either.  I make a lot of music and I'm not always trying to make \"beats\" or at least not ones that traditional 90's hip-hop fans would care about.  I was also at the peak of my trauma & anxiety from what happened prior in LA & Tampa,  So I wasn't really in the mode of the \"Dutchmassive\" that all these rappers on the east coast remember as,  The over-confident, call em out, battle rapper from the Mid/late 90's was not in building to say the least.  On top of that,  I evolved from that version of myself shortly after releasing my Debut album \"Junk Planet\" anyway.  My sophomore album on Rawkus \"Crush Your System\" was crafted with more humility and responsibility so even If I wasn't shaken up by traumatic events.  I don't know how or why anyone expected me to channel that younger version of myself.  Over the next few months, I did song's with Lord Digga,  started an album entirely produced by Apathy (Demigodz) all while taking moments to myself to escape and  hide while having existential crisis and channel that energy into what came natural to me, making beats.  I made \"Lua Cheia (f/ Kaelin Ellis)\" on my laptop,  sitting in a lawn chair, hidden in the forest.   I made \"Analysis Paralysis\" outside on the front porch at like 4am during one of the only times in Life I ever thought about taking my own life just to stop feeling this extremely heavy weight I couldn't seem to shake.  In other words,  while trying to be the Dutch all my Hip Hop friends wanted to be again,  I had to sneak time to make the genuine and unconventional music I really desired to create.  Late summer, at the turn of Autumn.  My Pops who I had not really had contact with for well over a decade reached out since he saw I was in NY.  He wanted me to come visit him for the weekend a few hours north of where I was living.....\r\n\r\nACT II: Long Story Short.  I've covered a bit of this Arc in previous backstories on my records on Catalog Works so to condense this a bit.\r\nThis Article will fill in some of the blanks so I can bring this story to its neatly wrapped up resolve.\r\n\r\nhttps://mecca83.com/2020/05/shawangunk-stomp-the-story-of-dutchyyys-uproot/\r\n\r\nACT III:  Everything is connected and has purpose, even the Chaos\r\n\r\nIn spring of 2015, my secluded mountain, return to nature healing Arc came to a close.  I had to once again return back to Tampa Bay after a Year of peace of self discovery in a magical place I never wanted to leave.  When I arrived in Tampa,  it rained for 32 days straight......  and I mean non-stop.  So all I could do was create in doors,  back on the same friends couch I jettisoned from in the first place.  Thankfully my friend, while not a musician himself, shares the same love and taste in music as I do.  So I was able to create minus any pressures or judgements allowing me to continue experimenting and pushing my limits.   \r\n\r\nI already messed up \"The Uproot\" by removing 4 specific tracks intended for that album and throwing them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and what was originally intended to be A Double album \"The Uproot / Traversal\" ended up with a different fate.  The laptop I created most of The Uproot was destroyed by water damage.  So I held off on releasing that album and decided to release just \"Traversal\" and release it out of the intended order by releasing it first.  I had too many songs stacked up,  So I knew I could only fit one more song but knowing that.  I really wanted to create the last song with intention, when the energy felt right.   On July 7th, 2015 I opened up Ableton.  I knew which sample would end this album,  I did the normal boring prep work, finding drums, getting the sample ready and something felt off.   It was ridiculously hot & humid and there was no way I wanted to end this album attached to Florida summer memories. If you are confused about this sentiment,  I invite you to let me explain further in form of lyrics:\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/ajar-produced-by-redacted-2011\r\n\r\nDid you listen to the link above?  Make more sense now?  If not, it's ok I'll continue anyway. \r\n\r\nJuly,  August,  September,  October...   months and months go by and global warming is a bitch.   It felt like Autumn would never come.  Then on October 24th 2015,  The first chilly breeze was felt.  It was now time,  Opened all the doors and windows and embraced the fresh air and then I opened up the project file I started back in July.   The cool weather didn't last long but I was already committed and on October 29th 2015, I Finalized and Exported the track.\r\n\r\nSo why the elaborate backstory just to get to a song I waited for a specific season to create?\r\n\r\nThe Theme of my life and fueled by specific parts of that story is,  I began creating music in the mid 90's.   I was birthed from Golden Era HipHop & Jazz.  It's what a very large portion of my long term fanbase expects and wants from me,  but I'm not just a Boombap lover.   I spend more time listening to Video Game Ost's,  obscure library music than I do listening to hip hop or beats.  It's harder to tell who inspired me more,  DJ Premier or Portishead haha..  So Traversal has a lot of music that doesn't fit that classic hip hop vibe that I know people expected from me.  So I wanted to end the album by creating an ode to an Era and expectations, with love, sincerity and optimism,  I had to Set my Intentions while completely freeing myself from that day forward of anyone's expectations.  \r\nand thus \"Set Your Intentions\" was born.\r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":230.557,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/set-your-intentions-1658687655","image":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmXomvmQXVxe3CcYAX1GiubqqNy5h1mxTFM18NNHcQroFz","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Set Your Intentions","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Traversal","description":"\"Set Your Intentions\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]"},"title":"Set Your Intentions","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Given all that is happening in the world and how the markets feel right now, I thought instead of my usual spacey, abstract or more heavy tracks,  I'd upload something that has a chance of lifting people up.   \r\n\r\nBackstory:  The instrumental was made early 2010, on FL Studio while getting some sun at the pool.  Originally titled \"A day at the pool\" and released on \"Yawn of the Gemini\" (May 23rd, 2010 / My Birthday)  [ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/yawn-of-the-gemini-2005-2010 ] This was one of my no samples, practice beats.  Back then, and still to this day,  I would/will alternate and dedicate different days to different methods of production,  I.E.  \"loops only day\",  \"Microchops day\",  \"No samples day\".  Then one day early 2015,  my homie C M O sent me an unsolicited email with a demo version of this song attached.  I was blown away, that he turned something that I considered a throwaway beat and turned it into such beautiful introspective opus.  So I told him, that I was in the process of releasing my new album \"Traversal\" and the next day,  he sent me this version.  \r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]\r\n\r\nThe album was too long to fit on a 90 minute cassette,  So I took that as a opportunity to make the cassette version different from the digital version. Different track order, Different master, and A few Different tracks in general.  So the digital version has a few songs that aren't on the cassette version,  and the cassette version has a few songs that aren't on the original digital version.   The cassette allowed me to really refine and sequence the album how I truly wanted it to be digested in full so personally,  I love the cassette version more.  but tracks like \"Esoteric\" didn't make it on to the cassette, along with \"The Chop & the Loop\", \"Dimples\",  \"Please Take Care\" (of yourself), \"64\" & the 3 Bonus tracks featuring my friends Toonorth & Sunjet,  which were just 3 different versions of my remixing my homie Apathy's song \"Chemical\"\r\n\r\n****I hope \"Esoteric\" provides you some healthy escapism. and as always.

With this remix I wanted to approach it as a collaborative process rather than just \"my take\" on the original song.  My initial idea was to take the majority of the Midnight Snacks series and try to compose one NEW idea stemming from my fav bits of the whole shabang.  I realized VERY quickly this was going to be too difficult to make something I love for the remix contest timeline (merp).  As a result what I settled on was trying to flip a song that was composed stylistically very opposite of what I do well; tempo being the easy contrast to work with.  I landed on Joysful Resistance Part 1 - already the had lyrics written in the title.  I treated MdCL's masterful piano parts as a \"hook\"; cutting/stretching/warping them into submission to try and fit the new tempo I was working with.  From there it was all about setting the intention around the groove.  Make ish' dance-able.  I actually worked a number of hours on the song on my twitch stream one day and as a result one of my homies/followers; percussionist Stingray from NY, was inspired and on the spot sent me a congo solo; which I messaged into the song real time (which did make the final mix).  It was at this point that I could not escape the \"live\" feeling both the original song and my new remix was asking of the production.  I recorded airy, dubby vocals to really drive something new making use of the song's title.  The vocals and reworked piano parts then gave me the shape for my arrangement; from there I multi tracked all the drums and percussion parts live that I felt like needed more organic movement.  Lastly; I was left with adding a bit of  jazz back into the song.  I contacted organ player, Abel Boquera, delivered instructions and then comp'd probably a solid 30+ minutes of organ parts to shape what you hear in the final.

This one is quite special...\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\nPicture a man strong of heart, but nearly broken. Vulnerable but unwavering as he summons as much strength as he can to fight and not crumble under his own weight or the weight of his circumstances. To reclaim his peace. To reclaim his personal power.\r\n\r\nIn that process of alignment - in learning and unlearning, there is true freedom in unapologetically following the heart. It is a path that perhaps provides a shortcut to happiness and fulfillment, but is far from easy. Nonetheless, one never truly loses in loving, living their purpose or being themselves. This is difficult to see at times. Though, that’s where inner fortitude, faith and persistence come in.\r\n\r\nDrawing from personal experience, this piece is a depiction of such a journey. While playing a show in Palmdale, California with a wonderful group “Dean Mucetti and the Rhythm Real” in April 2022, I was suddenly asked to perform solo in the middle of the set, since we were flying through it rather quickly.\r\n\r\nBeing where I was mentally, physically and spiritually at the time, I was pensive and felt exposed. Though, there was no time to think. I took a deep breath to connect to my heart space. This is what poured out from me.","duration":365.61,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xec29fd9fd64eb43a53f6917137355144ed5a3b8d/heart-1656519938","image":"ipfs://QmRgqc664wUioRJxm72U3owNTGjiMZ4fXRqHjF11oK77vR","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmc8p1FcNATyu9amdhf5zrsdm9QuJedfMaV1ZHUpeg7S9d","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Brian Hargrove - Heart","title":"Heart","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

I took the leap and decided to move to Los Angeles after taking what was supposed to be a 4-6 month long contract teaching at Cedars-Sinai Hospital.  Unfortunately, we taught them too well & too fast and the contract was cut short, only lasting a few weeks.  I was already committed to making Los Angeles my home but now I was limited on funds, and about to lose the hotel I was supposed to be at for months while searching for apartments, but As fate would have it,  I was about to get a life raft.  After jokingly posting on Facebook,  \"I'm hungry, someone bring me some food\".   Someone commented, \"You're in Los Angles?  I'm a huge fan of your music and my family owns a restaurant\".  It was my day off, so I commented. \"Come Scoop\" jokingly, not realizing he would want to follow through.   Long Story Short,  We became good friends and that night would change the course of my life.  Meeting multiple strangers who became best friends. When the contract ended.  My new friend (Anthony) allowed me to stay with him while I searched for a place to move into.   During this time, I taught him and a few of his friends (who are now my close friends) how to use FL Studio.  He was a huge fan of my music,  so I played him a bunch of unreleased music I never planned on releasing.  He lost his mind when I was adamant about never releasing the music I was playing him.   What he didn't know was a few months prior on Xmas night 2011,  My Laptop filled with my upcoming Dutchmassive album titled \"Romanticizing\" along with every beat I made from 2008-xmas 2011 was lost when hard drive got corrupted and dealt me the dreaded Blue Screen Of Death.  I didn't have any of it backed up on extra hard drives.  All that remained from 2008-2011 was the crappy first draft versions I burned to CD's for \"The Car Test\" and well,  I didn't take care of those either so they all had scratches and were sun damaged.  So the things I was playing him,  where unfinalized early versions of songs that I know became so much greater than the versions I was left with.  He wouldn't take no for an answer and eventually offered to pay my 1st month's rent and my security deposit if I swallowed my pride and uploaded the few early versions I salvaged to bandcamp. He didn't want any profits from it, he just wanted those songs to exist online and be heard by the public. I agreed and moved into my new apartment a few miles down the road from him.  Shortly after moving into my new place overlooking the port of Los Angeles,  My friend Angel (Kronika) introduced me to another producer who went by the name Ahwlee.  \r\n\r\nBackstory: ACT III\r\n\r\nAhwlee & I vibed pretty quickly. He would come stay at my apartment and make entire EP's on Ableton Live in one night and not even save what he made. He deleted some of the best beats I've ever heard and he did this frequently. While I was taking all night on a single flips that I would maybe finish at a later date.\r\n \r\n\r\nSo one night A few days before my birthday, while he was knocking out an entire EP in Ableton Live,\r\nhttps://bumps.bandcamp.com/album/dutchist\r\n\r\nand I was stuck working on one single song in FL Studio.\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/anglwngs\r\n\r\nI thought to myself \"How is able to knock out fully fleshed out albums during the same time it takes me to finish one song\" Later that night,  I said \"enough is enough, teach me Ableton please!\"  So he taught me everything he knew and the next day we made the song \"Medutayshun\" with Ahwlee on the drums and synths and me chopping on Ableton for the 1st time.\r\n\r\n\"https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/medutayshun-f-ahwlee\r\n\r\nThis would be the beginning of a new chapter for me.  I was very proficient in Ableton and could never go back to the slow and limited work flow I had while working in FL Studio.  I wanted to make one final beat in Fruity loops and then close the book on my FL Studio Arc for good.  So I made one final song in FL Studio on my birthday May 23rd 2012. titled \"Just Be Yourself\"\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/-just-be-yourself-\r\n\r\nA few months went by, and I was countless tracks in using Ableton.  I truly got distracted and got lost in a new extended burst of creative energy. Until one day, I believe it was rent day so September 1st if I'm remembering correctly, Anthony reminded me that I still owed him that album of unreleased tracks from my old hard drive that needed to be uploaded to Bandcamp.  \r\n\r\nMost of the songs were too badly damaged by scratches in the CD or sunspots so I salvaged what I could, I added a few beats I made in FL studio after moving to Los Angeles. Then, on September 12th, 2012 I reluctantly uploaded the album \"Blue Screen of Deaf\".  \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/blue-screen-of-deaf-2011-2012\r\n\r\nNever touching FL Studio again, becoming an Ableton main and moving to the next chapter creating what would later become the 2 hour Cassette \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"\r\n\r\n- Closing -\r\n\r\nThis backstory was pretty lengthy, and covered a lot of info that I would have preferred to reveal in future back stories for songs like \"ANGLWNGS\" or even \"Medutayshun\" (f/ Ahwlee) because the bulk of story revolves around those songs more than it does to \"insane go all don't we If\" but the reality is,  This song would have never been released to the public,  especially since it's an early, unfinished version of the song like 95% of \"Blue Screen of Deaf\" is.

I was jumping and bobbing around for weeks making this. I love to take art + music super seriously, but it's also just as important to just have fun for no reason other than enjoying making something cool. \r\n\r\nI also designed the cover art, and had just as much fun making that as the song. I just kept stacking more and more shapes on top of each other. I think the art has ~300 layers if I recall?

Its location is a mystery.\r\n\r\n// Station 2 // Field Notes\r\n\r\nThe lullaby describes “The Undersea Carousel” with a hallowed air, its lyrics illustrating in gorgeous detail not only the legendary object, but also the wonder and fortune bestowed upon whomever might encounter it.\r\n\r\nCuriously, though the song is well-known, especially in rural areas, we found it quite difficult to ask about its truth and history. We attempted questions about whether the carousel actually exists, on which planet it might be, around when it might have last been visited, and so on – and were unable to find residents who had any interest in discussing such matters.\r\n\r\nOne group of elders suggested, not without twinkles in their eyes, that if we wanted to know more about the carousels (notably, spoken of in the plural), we should ask Thuvratioow. This is the nickname of an old god no longer worshipped, who last held sway some sixty thousand years ago, when none of the outer Pleiades had yet been inhabited.\r\n\r\nWe began to discern a collective understanding among the Pleiadians, that these mysteries were themselves part of the lore. That such secrets held beauty, and even commanded power, in remaining secret. That inquiries made in pursuit of precision could, in certain situations, prevent the attainment of a greater knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt least, the puzzle of the song's story is perhaps outdone by the story surrounding the song.\r\n\r\n// Station 3 // Collector Perks\r\n\r\nThis is a 1/1 Catalog NFT track composed, performed, and pressed by Eric Pan (pandelic.eth).\r\n\r\nEvery owner of a pandelic.eth Catalog NFT also receives unlimited, “golden ticket” download access to Eric's entire published music catalog, in resolutions up to MP3 V0 and lossless WAV.

LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto. (this step also makes it possible for anyone else to take these songs of care, understand and even transform them in their own way: sing them to another, releasing them into freedom again, increasing their potency with each gifting."},"title":"The Undersea Carousel","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

At the time, I was out of town on A contract, teaching  at the hospital but I listened on my break and sent her back a message on IG. Letting her know I loved what I heard and added my critiques on the mixing.  She recorded over two  beats that were already officially released on my album/cassette, so I didn't put too much thought into it.  A few months later in March 2017  I asked if she minded if I posted one of the songs on my Soundcloud on her birthday: https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/mousey-mcglynn-adult-prod-by-dutchy-niceguy-x-vinny\r\n\r\nMsMMMcG did a lot of live performances so I told her that she can record vocals over any song of mine that inspires her.  Months passed and she said she wanted to record enough tracks for an EP. I said that's fine, as long as I can mix the vocals to my beats. She ended up choosing more beats from albums that have already been released, so I said I'm cool with the EP being a free promo thing because I personally didn't want to monetize tracks that I've already released and made money from. More time passed, she would send vocals as she recorded them but I was in the process of working on two new albums and a side project when I was home, and I was out of state traveling teaching at hospitals every other month, So admittedly, I was super busy and I procrastinated on mixing the tracks, until she lit a fire under me letting me know she wanted to shoot multiple videos for the songs.  When it came to mixing \"Song4u\" one of the songs she wanted to shoot a video for,  I realized she recorded her vocals over the Soundcloud / demo version of the instrumental \"Set Your Intentions\"  (from Traversal) So when I brought the vocals into my Ableton Live session to mix them, nothing properly line up.  So I had to do some finessing,  while also multi-tasking a few other deadlines I had to finish before leaving for my next out of state contract.  Sent out a few different versions, more time passed, and I finally agreed to her releasing the EP on Bandcamp & Streaming.  She was insistent on splitting any profits 50/50 but I declined and told her not to worry about splits because I still felt weird about double monetizing my beats. (I know, I know... I'm not the most business savvy artist on the planet)\r\n\r\nIn April of 2019 she released the \"Dutchess EP\" on bandcamp & Streaming\r\n\r\nDUTCHESS EP LINK: https://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep\r\n\r\nAlso releasing 3 videos from the EP throughout 2019,  One of which being \"Song4U\".\r\nVIDEO LINK: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/STg6K76aTWI\r\n\r\nThe more you know:\r\nThe Instrumental used for this song is from the 2015 album \"Traversal\" and it's originally titled \"Set Your Intentions\".\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/set-your-intensions\r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":214.909,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-song4u-f-msmmmcg--1658678429","image":"ipfs://QmT77AfQmCQoQr3qbzsWosDMDh7FwkacQmkQ6sZmHGohVb","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmeqVdouck6fPKhRYSPnurQbwCP2dE9VcnUGJmBn6m94nB","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"Song4u\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmT77AfQmCQoQr3qbzsWosDMDh7FwkacQmkQ6sZmHGohVb","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Dutchess EP","description":"\"Song4u\"\r\nProduced by: Dutchyyy\r\nVocals Written & Performed by: MsMMMcG (aka Margaret \"Mousey\" McGlynn)\r\n\r\nhttps://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep"},"title":"\"Song4u\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","trackNumber":7,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights. \r\n\r\nWith love and compassion,\r\n\r\nDot","duration":186.149,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/hazel-1656971619","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmYMNyr4zrxuEAXcmTaAw3S5xAwmVrMc192xbLGws81gAw","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Hazel","title":"Hazel","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Released world wide July 13, 2004 on CD / 2xLP.  \r\nFor context, I began writing and recording for Junk Planet late 1997 while also recording an album with my group at the time \"Equilibrium\" (Celph Titled, Majik Most & Myself) and finished recording the the last song for Junk Planet in 2002.  Time moved slower for music back then. There was no \"keeping up with daily content\".  You had the freedom to live and experience life and use that experience for inspiration to craft well thought out albums.\r\n   \r\n   I was taking my time recording my sophomore album \"Crush Your System\" An album I began writing & recording for in 2003, which would later be released on Rawkus Records as part of worlds first digital only campaign \"The Rawkus 50\" but i'm getting sidetracked.\r\n \r\nTaking my time, building an arsenal up of production from my favorite producers at the time:  Samiyam, 14KT, Take, Dakim, !llmind, Dela, SlopFunkDust, Mo0, etc... All friends I made through the power of Myspace.   I had just released my first official instrumental project titled \"The Drumlove EP\" as well as the mixtape \"Project: REACH\" when Take (Sweaton Klank) sent me the perfect beat.  He was able to match my voice and style so well,  but instead of me using the beat on my upcoming album he wanted me to be the only emcee to feature on his debut full length.  The pressure of knowing I would be the only person rapping on this album made me take writing this song very serious.  I didn't want to just do some typical braggadocios battle rap since I knew the album was going to more like a movie score in a sense rather than just a collection of random beats.   At the time,  I was dating a girl who was very inspirational and had me exploring things outside of my normal wheelhouse.  She had perfect recall when it came to dreaming and was able to lucid dream with ease. So the months leading up to writing \"Dream Suite\" I had been using a dream journal every morning and studying Astral Projection and Lucid dreaming in general.  Something I've only ever been able to achieve a few times in my lifetime and once I realized I was in control,  I would immediately wake up haha.  So I decided to make Lucid dreaming the subject matter for the song I was going to write.  Nearly everything I wrote about was true to form and directly inspired by the research I had been doing.  I did take one creative liberty and changed \"Greek Dream Temples\" to the inaccurate \"Egyptian Dream Temples\" but that's because I was obsessed with the Mysteries of Ancient Egypt since I was a child and thought Egyptian sounded \"cooler\" than saying \"Greek\".  Plus I needed a word with multiple syllables haha.  I recorded, mixed and mastered my vocals and sent them off to Take (Sweatson Klank) - The beat I wrote to was just a rough sketch, so when he sent me the final version with all the change up's and the outro that transports you to a different world.  I don't know what else to say.  This became one of my favorite tracks of all time, and I couldn't believe I was lucky enough to be apart of it.   \r\n\r\nYears later,  long after \"Crush Your System\" was released on Rawkus,  I released an updated version on bandcamp with added songs (since my 3rd solo album as Dutchmassive titled \"Romanticizing\" was lost on Xmas 2011 to corrupt hard drive resulting in the dreaded \"Blue Screen of Death\")  After losing all of my beats from 2008-2011 and the album I spent years writing and recording.   I just took a few extra songs I featured on, added them to Crush Your System and decided to hang up the mic and focus primarily on Production moving forward.   I know, I know, what a sad ending haha,  but truth is,  I'm an emcee at heart, so I never stopped rhyming.  I just stopped writing and recording albums.  Instead,  I began recording freestyles daily for fun.  What started out on voice memos,  graduated to a Tascam DR-05 in 2015.  The creative fulfillment that came with recording freestyles for fun without the pressure of them ever being heard was the ultimate therapy and would get me thru the toughest of days while also having fun keeping the spirit of the emcee alive 2015-present and thus was born DailyRambles aka \"The Reluctant Clap\"   \r\n\r\nThis Catalog Record is a 50/50 split with @sweatsonklank \r\nI wanted my Genesis drop as \"Dutchmassive\" to feature another Catalog Artist and it just worked out that one of my favorite songs I've recorded to date was produced by a producer who also an artist on Catalog Works =)\r\n\r\n*****Winner of this auction will receive A copy of \"Earthtones & Concrete\" on CD (Digipack) & 2xLP (Vinyl) from our personal collections*****\r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography over 110gb *****\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n*****Winner of the auction will get a 1TB Samsung SSD portable drive that not only holds everything on the cloud drive,  but all the Portals unreleased in super long raw form directly from their master folders strait from the SP404SX and All the long videos and twitch streams that are too large to upload anywhere*****","duration":303.282,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xad04cd3c5f71d5f4a1a5ba0de5c749818055d1c7/-dream-suite-prod-by-sweatson-klank-1657628479","image":"ipfs://QmQANi1dBV84dc9fDUREE494kvUjNe9729Gz3d4dZiVqDW","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPQPzUizrJ1JLGoRhciYk9NZKD5hGUag3kcs6Du3xmRPV","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchmassive - \"Dream Suite\" - Prod. by Sweatson Klank","title":"\"Dream Suite\" - Prod. by Sweatson Klank","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

So I already had some of them on my studio machine and edited them in some way. I could have taken it easy on myself and just finished one of the approaches. Instead, however, I went through each of the Midnight Snacks and made a list of what I like about them. I really like \"infinite\" melodies, similar to Mark's collaboration with Atjazz \"Awake We Stay\". And in Crush Velvet I found exactly this kind of melody that I wanted to work with. I also knew that Crush Velvet is a very personal track for Mark as he dedicated it to his late friend Phil Asher. That's why two things were very important to me: on the one hand, I wanted to pick up on the emotionality and put myself in Mark's situation in a musical way and, on the other hand, I wanted to work as much as possible with the technical means that were up-to-date at the beginning of 2000. That's why I recorded all the sounds with a 12-bit E-MU sampler, arranged the key elements on an Atari and only digitized them for mixing at the very end. This process took some time, but it gives the result a contemporary rawness that I felt was appropriate for my reinterpretation. I'm really happy with the result and the feedback I received during production and afterwards, and makes me curious to see where the journey is taking me.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThis remix was produced as part of the first Mashibeats remix contest and selected to be minted through community voting.\r\nPrimary collectors will also receive the ltd edition remixes color vinyl EP including this remix - estimated delivery late October 2022.","duration":337.685,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x9d7750ff4cfda1988ab08a7315d30064ab205806/mark-de-clive-lowe-crush-velvet-foursixone-remix--1658945262","image":"ipfs://Qmf1ay4q9txEn4A7puFvFeCBJq5e9cyzkwMJxE5vQU5uMv","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qme7MXCrWHGHWDq6UW5Hu3YjvwnkupxDa9KBurmXyFzTJv","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Foursixone - Mark de Clive-Lowe - Crush Velvet (Foursixone Remix)","title":"Mark de Clive-Lowe - Crush Velvet (Foursixone Remix)","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights. \r\n\r\nWith love and compassion,\r\n\r\nDot","duration":204.356,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/long-distance-1658187137","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmajyFSVYEWemRQHSahx11YC9WrC1Bsuh5nbLCaPB4naie","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Long Distance","title":"Long Distance","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

A musical adaptation of a Pleiadian folk song, \"The Cosmic Blink Expands\" offers homage to Maurice Ravel and Bill Evans, spoken from the quietude and vastness of space. Its title illuminates a distinctly Pleiadian perspective: life’s limitless possibilities blossoming from the single blink of a moment we have each been gifted.\r\n\r\n— Making of / Behind the scenes —\r\n\r\nthe first time I performed this song live, the audience reaction was a surprise.\r\n\r\nto tell the story right I'd like to go back to the beginning.\r\n\r\naround christmas in darkness of winter lockdown, I sat in front of a piano to play one note -- causing the following melody to unfold by itself. it was one of those songs nearly fully formed upon arrival, which happens occasionally. but this song felt beamed from the skies, reminiscent of a dream.\r\n\r\nthe time came to choose songs to debut on tour with Alex Wong. I hesitated to pick this at all. its quietness and lack of rhythm made me wonder about its \"show-appropriate\"-ness. but I thought about how it had been written during a songwriting sprint, how out of dozens of songs born that week I kept returning to it again and again. how love letters to Ravel and Evans are bookmarked inside its sheaves. how its power, for me, comes from its resolute tenderness.\r\n\r\nhearing listeners respond with \"I am floating in space\" and \"I want this mood to continue forever\" was deep catharsis. though the music came from mysterious origins, to me these words somehow also said: \"message received\".\r\n\r\nI'm excited to present this song as the first statement of LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES -- all songs and more about the project will be revealed soon, including lyrics for this one.\r\n\r\nit's an honor to work with Brian Trahan for his expert assistance through the recording and mixing journey, Keith Zarriello for the impulse and guidance to embark on this whole adventure in the first place, Alex Saltz of APS Mastering for his exemplary skills and aesthetic sensibilities. thanks also to Kyle McEvoy of Sonder House, and the team at Falling Sea records for the co-release.\r\n\r\nmuch love and gratitude to Juliette Viger for the visionary artwork <3","duration":127.347,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xe9b5a2529ad21454cb5e4d172dcb4bc501789463/the-cosmic-blink-expands-1660501998","image":"ipfs://QmSVixxzaRyX8fh1xajmsB5aDTmpyiBSxhb3FRUzXwH73g","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmStGYFkmRQ4cV5rffq9W1NP7CYWJS2Pzs3EJtK1Knpz2x","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Eric Pan - The Cosmic Blink Expands","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmSVixxzaRyX8fh1xajmsB5aDTmpyiBSxhb3FRUzXwH73g","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Lullabies of the Pleiades","description":"The lullaby is universal to all cultures, within and outside our star system. LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto. (this step also makes it possible for anyone else to take these songs of care, understand and even transform them in their own way: sing them to another, releasing them into freedom again, increasing their potency with each gifting."},"title":"The Cosmic Blink Expands","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Falling in love with someone with every bone in you is such a heavy feeling in your soul. When the relationship ends not because of betrayal, not because of lack of trust, not even because of lack of love. Sometimes relationships end due to lack of communication. When a relationship ends this way, it's hard to let go, it's hard to move on.\r\n\r\nAt least for one person in the relationship that is. \r\n\r\nI found out in 2021 that the one i loved deeply, who i was so kind to, so helpful, so generous to after the breakup...they had moved on. Quickly. 9 days later quickly. 2 years of a love so deep one can't believe that it could have meant nothing at all. How can someone who made you feel what real love is, move on so so so quickly? My heart had officially shattered.\r\n\r\nI tossed & turned with this questions for months. At the end of the day, it roots to so many answers. Psychologically, emotionally, egotistical. The list goes on. \r\n\r\nBut somewhere in the world lies a quote about seeing people for who they really are. As humans we tend to see what we want to see.

So, to find my way on to Catalog and my first vinyl through the Mashi Beats Remix Competition was yet another piece of the puzzle that was a perfect fit. \r\n\r\nIt's rare that you get multiple songs to play with for a remix, so working on the Mashi Beats remix competition was exciting for me. Whenever I do a remix I always try a few ideas as I feel it's the only way to know which one is the right one, and it took me a while to find my feet. I was determined to find something that felt like me, but kept the essence of the original too… I think I tried 4 different songs! In the end, as is often the case, the first idea I started was the one that made me feel the most excited. There were so many musical parts to chop up and build from it was like working with a great sample pack. I always aim to approach remixes the same way I make music, and I started by building some atmospheres and loops that carry enough emotion to pull me into the flow state. In the end I have to be able to get lost in a remix for it to feel right.. and for me this could fit easily on one of my own releases as well as on one of Mark’s.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis remix was produced as part of the first Mashi Beats remix contest and selected to be minted through community voting.

Falling in love with someone with every bone in you is such a heavy feeling in your soul. When the relationship ends not because of betrayal, not because of lack of trust, not even because of lack of love. Sometimes relationships end due to lack of communication. When a relationship ends this way, it's hard to let go, it's hard to move on.\r\n\r\nAt least for one person in the relationship that is. \r\n\r\nI found out in 2021 that the one i loved deeply, who i was so kind to, so helpful, so generous to after the breakup...they had moved on. Quickly. 9 days later quickly. 2 years of a love so deep one can't believe that it could have meant nothing at all. How can someone who made you feel what real love is, move on so so so quickly? My heart had officially shattered.\r\n\r\nI tossed & turned with this questions for months. At the end of the day, it roots to so many answers. Psychologically, emotionally, egotistical. The list goes on. \r\n\r\nBut somewhere in the world lies a quote about seeing people for who they really are. As humans we tend to see what we want to see. We refuse to see beyond what our heart sees. Love is blind, right?\r\n\r\n\"Fake\" is about being aware of how we see people vs. how they really are. Our soul always deserves to be loved truly & not diminished. We deserve to be loved with the same passion we love.","duration":187.344,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x17745542d194af33d235e39f00bc27736ccc1f2c/fake-1661376563","image":"ipfs://Qme1tzbvUswQ8qqL15CDx7HX4Ji84AJKqk4qVawrPVvt8Z","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmctAKpvdEHUDoWtDt2s6h6nY7DyeEnsQs57Arz341pdG8","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"SUBCIETY - fake","title":"fake","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

And two, he was from Columbus and, at the time, did not hear many with his sound. \r\n\r\nAround the spring of 2015, quite a few of us would chill and be creative over a mutual friend's crib. I was always connected with KMB cause he would sit quietly in a corner and just work, not paying much attention to all the noise that was going around him. We became friends, and this was the first song he produced of mine. At the time, I was still working a shitty warehouse job and trying to balance the 9-5 and artist life. I wanted to make something motivational and relatable because the reality is most of us had to/currently work a job while pursuing our passions.","duration":232.224,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xf873e05c28be2845f09c828dae42084b6b1c060e/afterhourz-anthem-1660166941","image":"ipfs://QmSjHXKvatnzFJtm4E7Xn1dWFczJ39Y6H8gr2TcMN9jKSh","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmV7koyeaPPkjTBtjG31Emuz2ficN4Y9UFnoHzTyhpxhbB","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dom Deshawn - AfterhOurz Anthem","title":"AfterhOurz Anthem","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

So I quickly reached out and let him know that I'm boarding a flight but will home in a few hours but will be cutting it super close and asked If I could submit the following the day. He said \"Midnight sharp, no exceptions\" So I landed at Tampa International, my friend picked me up and I told him we need to stop at Best Buy or somewhere I can purchase speakers since mine were stuck in storage back in Los Angeles at the time. Ran into Best Buy and they didn't have any decent monitors in stock so I purchased a little blue tooth JBL flip speaker. We got to his townhouse and I scrambled to download the sample with less than 2 hours until deadline. Opened up Ableton Live, Laid some basic drums down and went to work manipulating and micro-chopping the sample. Made something quickly and decided, it needed some dope change ups and some extra layering. Did my very best, mixing as I went along and exported right at the buzzer. Turned out to be one of my favorite tracks I've made due to the changes ups so I'm glad I went back to put in more time. I uploaded my track to Soundcloud 6 minutes after the deadline passed. He was definitely not joking when he told me \"Midnight sharp, no exceptions\" because he did not accept my entry haha. I didn't get discouraged, I ended up submitting to Flip Sessions 3, 4 & 6. I created an entry for 5, but didn't end up submitting it. I intended to use this track on my (at the time) upcoming album \"The Uproot\" but last minute pulled it to place on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to end out the tape and take us to the next chapter, and thus..... \"OneForShoes\" was born. \r\n\r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa. It sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling Cassette. Due to high demand and fomo, I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016. Once again, it sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row. Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable. To this Day, \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp. In fall of 2020, I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa. It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette. The problem was, I pulled 4 songs from what was supposed to be my follow up album \"The Uproot\" and placed them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" last minute. Those songs were \"OneForshoes\" / \"Evolution of a Shrug\" / \"The Scramble\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" (feat. ashtrejinkins & sleepyeyes) and removed a few songs that were created specifically for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\".  This decision derailed the release of \"The Uproot\" which it still remains officially unreleased to this day.  Instead I released \"Traversal\" next, which is actually the follow up album to the \"The Uproot\". \r\n\r\n(confusing huh?)\r\n\r\n *****All bidders on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography. *****","duration":118.805,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/oneforshoes-1660008841","image":"ipfs://QmYp5Tmj4fViL9muufYEkYE8Hitt3KwwqGdV6uaRBjbwnK","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmaSv8wn2tcrwh1X2zR21Jp7RkwXuzjp6j7URAGV4NXsCs","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - OneForShoes","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmYp5Tmj4fViL9muufYEkYE8Hitt3KwwqGdV6uaRBjbwnK","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"\"Chill Gawd, Chill\"","description":"\"OneForShoes\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/chill-gawd-chill\r\n\r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa.

At the time, I was out of town on A contract, teaching  at the hospital but I listened on my break and sent her back a message on IG. Letting her know I loved what I heard and added my critiques on the mixing.  She recorded over two  beats that were already officially released on my album/cassette, so I didn't put too much thought into it.  A few months later in March 2017  I asked if she minded if I posted one of the songs on my Soundcloud on her birthday (which is the demo version of Adult and varies from the version on the official \"Dutchess EP\"\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/mousey-mcglynn-adult-prod-by-dutchy-niceguy-x-vinny\r\n\r\nMsMMMcG did a lot of live performances so I told her that she can record vocals over any song of mine that inspires her.  Months passed and she said she wanted to record enough tracks for an EP. I said that's fine, as long as I can mix the vocals to my beats. She ended up choosing more beats from albums that have already been released, so I said I'm cool with the EP being a free promo thing because I personally didn't want to monetize tracks that I've already released and made money from. More time passed, she would send vocals as she recorded them but I was in the process of working on two new albums and a side project when I was home, and I was out of state traveling teaching at hospitals every other month, So admittedly, I was super busy and I procrastinated on mixing the tracks, until she lit a fire under me letting me know she wanted to shoot multiple videos for the songs.   Sent out a few different versions, more time passed, and I finally agreed to her releasing the EP on Bandcamp & Streaming.  She was insistent on splitting any profits 50/50 but I declined and told her not to worry about splits because I still felt weird about double monetizing my beats. (I know, I know... I'm not the most business savvy artist on the planet)\r\n\r\nIn April of 2019 she released the \"Dutchess EP\" on bandcamp & Streaming\r\n\r\nDUTCHESS EP LINK: https://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep\r\n\r\nAlso releasing 3 videos from the EP throughout 2019\r\n\r\nThe more you know:\r\n\r\nThe Instrumental used for this song is from the 2015 (Digital Version) album \"Traversal\" and it's originally titled \"The Chop & The Loop\".\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/the-chop-the-loop","duration":225.123,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-the-stakes-f-msmmmcg--1661797600","image":"ipfs://Qmb5kn2z5KXS23qNDpsQmF6T5nS1FjRyQS9vMHSSkeKb12","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmR6f9KEurYdZHmSPuthBKjWdCxzvwHr3UgtPraDhg1MEY","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"the stakes\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://Qmb5kn2z5KXS23qNDpsQmF6T5nS1FjRyQS9vMHSSkeKb12","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Dutchess EP","description":"Album Produced by: Dutchyyy\r\nVocals Written & Performed by: MsMMMcG (aka Margaret \"Mousey\" McGlynn) \r\n\r\n+ https://www.msmmmcg.com/\r\n+ https://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep"},"title":"\"the stakes\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

If auction ends at .5 eth or above, winner will be added to the royalty splits on DISTROKID in perpetuity for a 20% split and the 2nd highest bidder will receive a 10% split (If there is only one person bidding, they will receive the full 30% royalty split on the single)\r\n\r\n3.)

If you're not already using DistroKid, you'll get a 50% discount to sign up!  I will need the email address that you already use or would like to use for DistroKid for this to work. Until you accept my invitation, your assigned split of the earnings will be held in DistroKid's bank. Once you accept and create an account, the held earnings will be available in your own Bank within 24 hours. Bank access is permanent so if you decide not to renew your DistroKid membership you will still be able to keep earning royalties and withdraw it.  If you aren't familiar with how streaming payouts work on DistroKid or how long it takes for reported earnings to hit after music is first uploaded. Feel free to visit DistroKid & look through the FAQ's\r\n\r\nWhile it's my hope that you collect my music with the intent of holding onto it forever. In the name of Utility, If you would like to use these Streaming Royalties as an incentive to sell to another collector for any reason I can either transfer your full split to the person who collects it from you, or I can add them in at any time for whatever percentage you and that person agree on based on your percentage of the splits (mine will remain the same) This of course requires a bit of trust & communication.  So feel free to reach out to me Privately on twitter @dutchmassive. \r\n\r\n* I'm also willing to add this feature on other uncollected songs of mine on Catalog so feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss further.\r\n\r\n*also because of this unique added utility, I set the the creator share to 15% for this release instead of my usual 10%*\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt at saying thank you & bringing more value and building lasting bonds with my collectors.  I've rejected the streaming model for years and have so much music I could have uploaded and decided not to, I'd like to change how I approach streaming and start uploading more music instead of exclusively posting to bandcamp or hoarding it away in the \"Dutchyyy VS the Algorithms\" cloud drive.  We will see how this goes,  maybe it will become the start of exciting future and you will be the catalyst. =)","duration":174.602,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/jawn-adelphia-1660562772","image":"ipfs://QmYbmHimiykWLaXiFCdjJDpgx1VTd8gkUaj4no1cKWkE9U","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmWg2uxXeVSLvKfFNErMaYXnBb1gJoUYqsK77JoDhAMmXe","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Jawn'adelphia","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmYbmHimiykWLaXiFCdjJDpgx1VTd8gkUaj4no1cKWkE9U","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"\"Jawn'adelphia\" (Evolving Portals)","description":"\"Jawn'adelphia\" (Evolving Portals)\r\n\r\nProduced / Composed by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\nBackstory / Details available at: \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/portals-jawnadelphia\r\n\r\nreleased December 25, 2021"},"title":"Jawn'adelphia","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

I'll be taking 0% creator share on this one. \r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\nNot much of a backstory here,  back in 2017 when twitter was plagued by the same 20 rotating music production Hot-takes, the age old question of which takes more skill, Sampling or playing instruments was trending.  The days of being able to just focus on art,  then post said art to social media with a link is gone.  You must engage or perish haha, so I respectfully engaged.  As a producer that does both,  I prefer to sample.  Not just loop up samples (tho I also enjoy loops and there is nothing wrong with loops),  but I like to mangle samples into new worlds so they are no longer recognizable or able to be detected by any form of \"content I.d.\". Turning Samples into instruments through a billion micro chops is my favorite pass time and anyone paying attention without a doubt knows this.  However,  I've been making non-sample based music for over 2 decades as well.  Someone on twitter responding to my neutral attempt to squash this age old argument so we can focus on more important things said \"What would you know, all you do is sample anyway\".  When I told them,  I do everything under the sun, skill and level of difficulty like music in general is all subjective. What feels impossible to some is a simple as breathing air to others and vice versa. All that matters is creating art you enjoy creating.  They then challenged to me to make a \"Chill-hop type beat\" in an hour.  30 minutes later A track I never intended to release was born \"Tingles\".  I've been watching Asmr since 2015 to relax,  so I hopefully the track title makes a little more sense.  \r\n\r\nMay you find peace during turbulent times.   \r\n\r\nPeacePeace. \r\n\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":222.067,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/tingles-1655114647","image":"ipfs://QmYkPrBpUPqG8s6hNvtjEjDvVmYB11vMjK9MbTiCNf5TiY","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmef3TfM5Pd8sMH15eH7PepFGPb2Dpm6RCwYPmsHhrz5Zw","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Tingles","title":"Tingles","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Examples: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7y7ezlysH53CCHbRt72PdS \r\n\r\n  He also appeared on my sophomore  \"Dutchmassive\" album titled \"Crush Your System\" released late 2007 on Rawkus Records (Song originally recorded in 2004 for his  unreleased album titled \"Godspeed\") \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/life-lines-f-surreal-produced-jeremy-ian-thomas\r\n\r\n   Jeremy was visiting from Los Angeles at the time, so it was dope to run into him by chance and catch up since even back then,  It was rare to see me out in public at events.  We ended up in a conversation about the current state of music, where for the previous few years, a lot of \"Beat Scene\" producers were pivoting to making more dance / industry friendly music that no longer sounded like the music they were known for.  I think the convo was sparked based on me uploading \"Where are we headed?\" to soundcloud, which was my sonic response to this topic the year prior. ( you can read that backstory here: https://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/where-are-we-headed- )\r\n  At the time Jeremy was heavily inspired by Kanye's Auto-tune Arc and actually preferred the more industry friendly direction a lot of people were going, which at the time blew my mind and caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong,  I enjoy pop, dance, and more commercial sounding music as well, but I was definitely sad to see so many of my favorite producers changing their entire sonic identity to try and ride the  current wave that had gained so much momentum at the time.  He spoke about the science of Major Chords and how they resonate more with the general public. People that just turn on FM radio and don't really go out their way to dig for music they love. A topic I was very familiar with at the time. Since I had recently watched a video about the same few Major chords, scales being used in the majority of the top100 pop radio hits for a few decades running.  We both had to leave the venue pretty early on in the night, so we cut the convo short, agreed to disagree,  hugged,  said peace and I ended up bouncing shortly after.   \r\n   As soon as I got home,  I loaded up Ableton with the aim of making a Anti-Pop, Radio friendly track haha.  A defiant response to the sentiment that you had to use happy Pop chords to appeal to the general public.   I went in multiple directions pretty rapidly,  I didn't want to create a trap song but I still wanted to keep the track up-tempo.  I love House music and have released a few house tracks over the years since 2006 so I didn't want to go in that direction and keep things out of my comfort zone.  Ironically starting with the same sample I used for \"The Turning Point\" then switching gears multiple times and touching on multiple emotions that could be seen as \"uncomfortable\" by \"The General Public\" before ending the song by re-playing the \"Buck Town\" sample on my synths. Exported the track,  made simple artwork, and immediately uploaded it Soundcloud before midnight.  \r\n\r\n https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/dutchy-no-pop-chords\r\n\r\nWhen I moved back out to Los Angeles later that year,  We ended up grabbing dinner with some friends and he laughed and said he knew my song was direct response to our conversation at \"Ol' dirty Sundays\" If that conversation didn't happen, this song wouldn't exist so I'm glad I decided to leave the house that night instead of staying in.\r\n\r\nIn 2020,  I decided to begin releasing a series of unreleased songs and tracks created between albums or that I couldn't fit on albums titled \"Beat Hoarder\".  The Intention was to release a new volume every few months to all streaming services since I have so much unreleased music that doesn't belong on any album.  I ended up releasing Vol. 1 on bandcamp along with the pre-order for \"The Uproot\" on cassette. \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/beat-hoarder-vol-1\r\n\r\nA few days later, I got an eviction letter from my landlord. After a year of battling the leasing company and going thru a failed black mold remediation they had me living in for 2 years. The moment the \"eviction memorandum\" was lifted in Florida.  They used the pandemic to kick me out instead of properly getting rid of the mold and just rent to new unsuspecting tenants.  This was super stressful on-top of already super stressful times so all my plans for this series and \"The Uproot\" cassette got derailed.  A week prior to the eviction letter, My uncle had been trying to get me to move in with my 93 year old grandmother who lived alone and needed someone to take care of her, especially during the height of the pandemic, but I didn't want to leave my house and all my plants and lose the ability to create music 24/7 as loud as possible without worrying about bother neighbors. So the eviction was glass half full at least and had a positive outcome.  So I packed up my 2 bedroom, 2bath House,  placed almost everything in storage and moved into this tiny 10x12 room in a retirement community and focused on live streaming, video editing and real time, long form live sessions #EvolvingPortals where everything is raw and in the moment since I lost the ability to play music loud in speakers to properly mix outside of headphones. Long story short, I basically got distracted forgot about my plans to release the Beat Hoarder series in general.   Maybe I'll resume that now.  \r\nIf / when this record is collected.   I'll submit Vol. 1 to my DSP / distributor and make it available on all streaming services a month out from when this record is collected =)\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":262.165,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/no-pop-chords-1656910251","image":"ipfs://QmPXaZcWf5qmbaCntgXbXNAypqKWq3fk53mdYSrawLY9ng","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmS5sPhxsoPLp3xy8c6DqrfccC6VbbhAF2bA3ygyioYX16","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - No Pop Chords","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmPXaZcWf5qmbaCntgXbXNAypqKWq3fk53mdYSrawLY9ng","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"BEAT HOARDER VOL. 1","description":"Track 5 - \"NO POP CHORDS\" - produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\nBEAT HOARDER VOL. 1 \r\n(A collection of outtakes and unreleased tracks that didn't make it on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\", \"Traversal\" or \"The Uproot\" (Circa 2012-2017)\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/beat-hoarder-vol-1"},"title":"No Pop Chords","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto.

But Why? \r\nThis was very first long form Portal I captured on my SP404, but to understand the significance of this recording. Let me start from the beginning.\r\n\r\nWhat are these Portals?\r\n\r\nPortals are live recorded sessions, capturing the entire process of making music in real time. Nothing is Finalized, all mistakes have a purpose, all fumbles build to evolving ideas. The Patient Ear is rewarded. \r\n\r\nHow did we get here?\r\n\r\nI've created multiple albums worth of songs from 2017-Present. Yet I haven't released an official  album since I dropped \"Traversal\" on Cassette shortly after my mother passed late 2016 while I was living in Los Angles. After a lifetime of living in apartments, getting evicted nearly each time for noise complaints, after couch surfing while traveling and Traversing across the country bouncing from Los Angeles to New York non stop. I moved back to Tampa and finally rented my first house in April of 2017.\r\n\r\nNo more noise complaints, No Relationships to distract me. No room mates or family.  Just solo and super isolated alone in a 2 bedroom house a half a mile away from the ocean (Gulf of Mexico). Living alone, So close to nature in walking distance with no one around that I could bother or that would question what or how long I was creating. (if you ever lived with a producer, you probably understand the pain of listening to us audition 600 snares in a row before finally choosing one, and that's just choose one drum haha) I was able to experiment and create endlessly. I'd black out for 16 hrs at time with extreme creative tunnel vision and come to, realizing I was on my 40th version of flipping the same sample. I would have so many different variations I liked,  I could never choose or settle on which version I would choose to make a final beat.\r\n\r\nThere was something about finality that I wanted to defy with every fiber in my being.  I just couldn't find the desire to complete or polish tracks. I put so so so much love into my official albums. A lot of emotion, time & energy go into making long elaborate journeys that flow like a story. So in an age where albums maybe have about 10 to 12 one minute tracks, and algorithms that make it near impossible to reach the fans we've spent all these years building up. I found myself needing to slowdown and re-evaluate how to navigate in this brave new music industry. I put a pause on releasing new albums. However I never stopped creating. Truth is, I've made more music from 2017 to present,  then I made from 1995-2016 combined.  All while having the most fun  i've ever had experimenting while no one was focused on me.  So many long sessions of inspiration and I wasn't capturing any of it.  I began thinking about music in a different way.  Thinking about our favorite albums.  The collection of songs that only last a few minutes each.  Knowing that to get to those refined final versions.  Hours or days of creating went into shaping them into the tracks we end up with.  I thought about albums like Miles Davis \"Bitches Brew\" and Arthur Verocai's 1972 self titled album and thought to myself,  how crazy would it be if we had access to the entire creative process for those albums, or any of your favorite artists albums.  The jam sessions and sketches before they turned into the truncated and finalized versions we ended up with.. Magic tends to happen during the experimental phase of music production,  a lot of which is never heard on refined and released songs. Think about it like this,  you ever noticed how people do their best work when the pressure of being recorded isn't there.  Ever did something so inspired and just couldn't replicate it once you remembered to press record.  I became obsessed with wanted to document those possible moments of magic, mistakes and all but unfortunately,  I wasn't able to pull this off in Ableton alone,  Id capture long takes,  but the moment I pressed the stop button,  it would stop the recording (resample) which led to hundreds of recorded files and killed my hard drive space very quickly.    I needed an external source to capture everything I was doing on my computer.  So I decided to stream on twitch.   I would stream my sessions for hours, and forget I was streaming, completely neglecting chat because I so tunnel in the creative zone.  I would start to read back the chat after I ended the stream and realized people where trying to interact and ask me questions and felt neglected.   I felt bad because I wasn't purposely ignoring anyone,  I just have severe ADHD and I get lost in the creative process, constantly moving from idea to idea which is why I wanted to begin capturing the entire process in the first place so I could try and understand how I work while in this meditative state.   People started making a big deal about me not interacting with chat when I was live so I had to disclaimer my streams with intent and label them as a Portal opening inside my home that allows you to just see and hear what I'm doing but I'm lost in the portal and can't see you.    This went over well and people would sit and watch me for hours at time just to see where I was going to take things.   The twitch culture was changing and I started to notice more and more new people come in and lose interest when I didn't answer their questions.   So on January 4th 2019.  I promoted my first live stream in which I would be periodically  popping out of my creative zone to make sure I could interact with chat.   I began the stream in the morning playing ambient, improv keys and practiced looking at chat,  I then began to go thru some sessions,  allowing chat to look thru the file names and choose which session I would open.  It was dope, like I was hanging out with people in my house, but I'm still me, so I'd go long periods where I'd get lost in a project and forget about chat haha.  As someone who loves a challenge,  I decided to let chat send me samples to flip.   The stream ended up being 10 hours,  and because I was unable to hyper focus in my zone and felt the pressure of knowing chat was watching and craving interaction,  I had this voice in the back of head to constantly keep changing up the sample.  Which worked out because it forever altered how I approach sessions.    \r\n\r\nYou can watch the entire 10 hour live stream here for Free.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1o8T4qm6kHwuos6h_3cLbkYgX8QvDBXkb/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThis session would end up fundamentally changing how I approach music and ended up becoming the first #EvolvingPortal  A project file I would revisit over and over for the next 3 years.  Constantly resampling what I did the previous session and evolving it into something new.  I perfected this method by 2020 and went absolutely bonkers evolving multiple portals until I eventually forgot how to create a normal, short song haha.  \r\n\r\nBut it all began with this Project file titled:\r\n\r\n\"I should have saved this hours ago\" or \"ishstha\" for short.\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/portals-i-should-have-saved-this-hours-ago\r\n\r\nThis isn't every session for this project file.   If you inspect the Artwork, you will see how many different versions exist.  I still have never exported the initial version I began creating in that 10hr live stream,  but the version on bandcamp has the 2 most recent Portals I recorded in 2021 plus the video attached in the bandcamp link is a truncated snippet version of the newest most evolved version in which I did all the visuals for as well. Plus, one other portal which brings us back to this 1 of 1 you are reading about now and why it's so important to me.\r\n\r\nCapturing my sessions on twitch was nice.  But converting twitch streams to audio files would result in super degraded audio quality. So I first attempted to capture my audio coming out of my audio interface and into my portable Tascam-DR05 but all the recordings would come out thin and didn't sound anything like they did in Ableton.   I sold my OG SP404 a few years prior,  but remembered I could resample for an extended amount of time when I had it even though I never used it in that manner.  So I copped a SP404SX from the homie, even though I wanted the OG404 again,  I wanted to test this method out as quick as possible so I payed to have SX shipped overnight and went to make sure I bought any cable I would need to execute pulling this simple task off.   The SP arrived the following evening after the sun went down. I opened up the project file \"I should have saved this hours ago\" created a new version, added a few new samples into the project for some new creative energy.   Hooked up the SP404,  Pressed Record and thus was born the first, long form, in the moment live captured Portal as one long file.   \r\n\r\nASMR.WAV\r\n\r\nI've gotten way more advanced in my methods evolving portals since, While this may not be my favorite Portal.  It is the most pivotal and special one since it was the first time, I realized I would be able to pull of my vision.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've recorded thousands of hours worth of Portals.  32 minutes is now a short \"song\" to me.   Most ranging from 1hr to a few hours each.  Due to live, real time nature of Portals,  if you don't have patience or faith in where I'm going take things,  I recommend approaching long Portals like you would putting on a new record you found to dig for samples, and maybe skip around at first,  because most portals are albums inside albums with the dopest music I've ever made tucked in between the weirdest experimental pockets.  In a world obsessed with short form content,  Portals have no chance of surviving in terms of marketing or monetary value.   All streaming services like Spotify pay fractions of a penny per stream.   I can't imagine a 3 hour opus getting millions of unskipped plays.   I had to have bandcamp, specifically and manually increase the size of my uploads because the wavs were so large, I couldn't even fit a fraction of a portal, which brings me to the other difficulty.  Attempting to separate and/or name hours of improv recording that changes so often while also revisiting the early parts for new passes to evolve the ideas in different ways.   Because of these issues and file size limits,  Most portals remain unreleased with a few exceptions that exist on bandcamp,  even more for bandcamp subscribers and even more exist on \"Dutchyyy VS the algorithms\" master vault cloud drive and because that drive holds most of released discography also,  I have to be selective with what I upload to not max out the 200gb limit which I'm quickly approaching with 142 of 200gb used.\r\n\r\nSo for this Auction,  I'm going to do something different.   \r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n*****Winner of the auction will get a 1TB Samsung SSD portable drive that not only holds everything on the cloud drive,  but all the Portals unreleased in super long raw form directly from their master folders strait from the SP404SX and All the long videos and twitch streams that are too large to upload anywhere*****","duration":1920.052,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/asmr-wav-evolving-portals--1656926509","image":"ipfs://QmRafs6UTjuT1ihKG3QiPWvQPdUzzh4m1inB1pDCn4sKUn","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmWh3FKEvrRJdUZjCUrVCpfWaxsDCVcBpSrnVNi57WjrCs","mimeType":"audio/flac","name":"Dutchyyy - ASMR.WAV (Evolving Portals)","title":"ASMR.WAV (Evolving Portals)","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Included in the primary auction is a custom merchandise package and two tickets to any Dot show (festivals excluded). \r\n\r\n50% of profits from the \"Early Days\" series will also be donated to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights.","duration":213.551,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/higher-higher-1661355235","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmf6CW3h2woifFK6jCjYAaMzWUx3s7b9zP5FT5n22MFavT","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Higher Higher","title":"Higher Higher","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Its haunting melody exhorts the listener to take comfort in the unknown, in solitude, and even in danger.\r\n\r\n\"There is safety in darkness /\r\nbut not if you fear it\"\r\n\r\n...is the only line that repeats. Evocative images appear in the song's bridge, in particular windswept cliffs by the sea and rain-drenched tree canopies towering above, swaying from fierce hurricanes in the darkness of night, providing no shelter or warmth.\r\n\r\n// Station 2 // Field Notes\r\n\r\nA striking and unusual song, especially as compared to the lullabies genre near-universally. We have found that most lullaby lyrics attempt a direct approach towards assuaging the fears of a loved one, through assurances of safety and expressions of care.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Wild Forest Reigns\", the listener is reminded that she is alone, that her insignificance, amidst nature's awesome powers, is the thing to be celebrated. Though the words and music are not harsh, and in fact are at times quite beautiful, they also cannot be described to swaddle or coddle the intended audience.\r\n\r\nWhen we interviewed performers of this lullaby – found prevalently among cultures regardless of proximity to wilderness regions – we often encountered an ardent belief that this lullaby occupied an important place within the Pleiadians' sense of self-identification. Its comportment with that fierce and even rugged independence Pleiadians are known for sits nonetheless alongside a delighted, mirthful awareness that the dangers of the world hold their own unique power to affirm joy and life.\r\n\r\n// Station 3 // Collector Perks\r\n\r\nThis is a 1/1 Catalog NFT track composed, performed, and pressed by Eric Pan (pandelic.eth).\r\n\r\nEvery owner of a pandelic.eth Catalog NFT also receives unlimited, “golden ticket” download access to Eric's entire published music catalog, in resolutions up to MP3 V0 and lossless WAV.

LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto. (this step also makes it possible for anyone else to take these songs of care, understand and even transform them in their own way: sing them to another, releasing them into freedom again, increasing their potency with each gifting."},"title":"The Wild Forest Reigns","trackNumber":6,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

We were both crushed and devastated the day we found out and still decided to go to dinner reservations that same night. \r\n\r\nAfter that very tough conversation, I found out I had a lot to learn about the infertility journey we were about to embark on. However, one night while watching a series on Netflix, there was a scene where a woman who was also diagnosed with infertility went to a support group for other women dealing with the same. During the session, the group leader asked them to repeat the phrase “I am not broken.”\r\n\r\nA light bulb went off! I had already been on my computer, messing with some production and immediately began recording the chords and finding the drum rhythms to what became the song that is now.\r\n\r\nI initially wanted the record to just be for my wife but she urged me to put it on my most recent Gold Fangs On Sunday album. Since then, we’ve shot visuals and the song alone before and after release has touched so many women who deal with infertility and image insecurities. \r\n\r\nUTILITY:\r\n\r\n-\tThe collector will be inducted into the Gold Fangs Society which comes with its own set of perks and privileges that will be later revealed.\r\n-\tThe collector will also receive a 1 of 1 pat junior t-shirt.

Originally created with the intent of being released on \"The Uproot\".  It was one of four songs I pulled last minute to include on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to showcase more current music since the Majority of Chill Gawd, Chill was created 2012-2013.\r\n\r\n ( https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/the-uproot )\r\n\r\nThe theme & inspiration of the song was in line with most of music created for \"The Uproot\" which was rebelling against the current Meta and Trend of the time (which is still relevant) of switching up to making more short, upbeat, dance type music.   I have nothing  against short songs,  upbeat or dance music.  I make that type of music as well but the majority of people at the time were pivoting so hard from their originally identity,  that I couldn't tell who's music was who in a blind listening test and I was pretty vocal about it which didn't earn me any  \"cool points\" haha.   I missed hearing music that rewarded the patient ear with slow builds and subtle changes and told a story, so I decided to stop worrying about what anyone else was creating and be the change I wanted to see.

The age of beat collectives,  I was apart of so many during the soundcloud era (Astral Basement, Soulection, FlyByNight, Expansions Collective, Cosmic Compositions,  Collective Resonance, Rootnote collective , etc)   \r\n\r\nIt wasn't until July 19th 2013  I got to meet RND1 in person for the first time at the Astral Basement show for Beat Soup at PooBah Records (Rest in Peace Ras G)  in Pasadena.   I remember meeting RND1 for the 1st time and him being so shy and quiet in person,  I noticed he looked cold so I gave him my Jacket to wear (something he must of really appreciated because I forgot about this but it's something that stuck with him for years to follow as he always reminds me) It was crazy to me this producer that I basically fanned out over constantly was so humble and reserved and we just clicked instantly.   RND1,  like most amazing producers I know has the all too common \"BEAT HOARDER\" syndrome.  He does release music,  but I have countless folders upon folders of the greatest music I've ever heard dating as far back as 2012 and he's yet to release any of it haha.   We grew closer as friends after I moved away from Los Angeles and he was the first person I went to for beats when I was living in New York and entertaining the idea of recording another \"Dutchmassive\" album.   He sent me batch after batch and instead of writing to anything, a new series would be born.  \"DailyRambles\" (The Reluctant Clap)  A series where I would blindly load up batches of beats I haven't listened to yet on my portable Tascam DR-05 and attempt to Freestyle over whatever I hear (this was my way of gauging if a beat had potential to sit and write to) and while I didn't end up writing or recording another \"Dutchmassive\" album,  I recorded 6 years worth of freestyles (Dailyrambles) and that all started by RND1 sending batches of absolute heat.  \r\n\r\nIn 2015,  I moved from New York back to my home town of Tampa, FL which came with very different energy and challenges than I had living on a secluded mountain in NY or the overstimulating energy of Living in Los Angeles,  So I decided to finish an album I began while living in Los Angeles, continued in New York and now would close that Chapter back in the state I tried my hardest to escape.  It was really important that I had a collab with RND1 on this project, so he sent me batch of beats he recently started and I didn't even make it through the entire folder before asking him to send me the Ableton Session for this beat. Most of ground work had already been laid, but I was able to go in and Dutchify it up enough adding an intro, horns, layered chops, some drums and drop outs etc but this is the one collab where I can say,  I didn't do most of the heavy lifting.   Usually I just get a drum loop and then do everything from there with very few exceptions.   There's much more to the RND1 x Dutchyyy story,  but we will pick back up where we left off in future backstories for future uploads.  To Be Continued  =)\r\n\r\n\"Stop Sleeping In So Much\" was the 2nd to last song created for \"Traversal\" and I'm very thankful to have crossed paths with RND1 and gained a best friend / brother in process.\r\n\r\none of my favorite instrumental albums of all time is by RND1\r\n\r\nhttps://trashsupply.bandcamp.com/album/imaginary-wknd\r\n\r\nYou can find more of his music here:\r\nhttps://rnd1.bandcamp.com/\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rnd1 \r\n\r\nand hopefully soon @ https://beta.catalog.works/rnd1\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience \"Traversal\" the way it was intended to be digested.

Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights.","duration":171.781,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/nova-s-theme-demo-mix--1663211453","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmQiWdsbbuMfveZoZrj7TfSvMX64jyhEDnXY8zDTKSykgK","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Nova's Theme [Demo Mix]","title":"Nova's Theme [Demo Mix]","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

With this album, Wylie attempts to capture that feeling of creative freedom and bliss, a sonic journal, a collection of thoughts, feelings and experiences that the artist savored and with each song tries to provide a small glimpse into the life of its creator.\r\n\r\nCable’s collaboration with Gene Coye is the most direct reference to this influence with the title of their track, “The Montreux Palace Hotel,” building on the first connections they made during their time at CalArts when Cable took drum lessons from Gene Coye, and the extensive roads each has travelled through music since. Extensive instruments were used to construct Warmed By The Sun, including the Oberheim Viscount Joint Venture OB3, The Kitten by Octave, Roland JP-08, Roland TR-8, Moog Sirin, Arturia Keystep, and Ableton Live with stock ableton soft synths and effects. The record also features original samples graciously sent from friends of Cable, including Mike Gao, Debroka, Elusive, Lightfoot, Carmack, and Paint (Huxley Anne & Tsuruda). Mastering for Warmed By The Sun was completed this summer by Grammy Award winning engineer Daddy Kev at his Cosmic Zoo facility in LA.\r\n\r\nConjoining structured songwriting elements within the vast spectrum of the beat scene’s unwavering search for new harmonic and rhythmic identity, Warmed By The Sun serves as Cable’s most forward thinking and adventurous work in that context. Emotionally provocative and energetically transfixing, Warmed By The Sun embodies the direct meaning of the LP title and goes into the bliss state of music creation where genre or scene are in the rearview. “The simple interpretation seems to me to just be the feeling of being warmed by the sun, sitting on a beach or in a park or on a hot rock and just relaxing and feeling safe and at peace.\" Cable explains. \"I feel like the phrase has a sort of holistic and healing or comforting feeling to it naturally. Since this is for a mixtape and will also be pressed on tape, and since I was thinking about that format specifically when I made the collage for the cover, it occurred to me that there is sort of a secret inside joke about tapes getting left out in the sun and getting warped. Warped tapes have also been an important sample source throughout time and I've even actually physically done that in the past where I left tapes out in the sun and then resampled them to get weird sounds. Have to give credit for that idea to my friend Chris Adams aka AHEE, he used to warp tapes and use them as samples in his old found sound / music concrete releases we did in the early days of the label.”\r\n\r\nWarmed By The Sun, like all of Cable's works, erases the notion of monolith and raises the flag of community and diversity. Tracks like “New Loops,” “French 75,” “Conn Loyalist,” and “Ahmad’s Blue ‘73 Coupe” are reminiscent of the era when artists such as Dibiase, Knxwledge, Jonwayne, and Samiyam began sparking waves in the name of beat scene. Album opener, “Alone,” is Cable’s most dynamic song to date, immersed in stark lyricism that interweaves around fast traveling synth tandem lines and slow grooving drums that splinter outward during that track’s final moments of instrumentalism. “Big Brane Debroka Flip'' is pure low end bass bliss, with a ruptured and deepened atmosphere of sound interwoven into the sampled flute, synth, and DJ scratches. A continued state of musical excavation into modern bass forms presents itself in tracks like “Crystal Lattice Structure,” “Cute Gesture,” “Butterfly Knife,” “Norwich Drill (145bpm)\", and “Rose & Thorn.” The dynamics and songwriting push even further with tracks like “Moderatto Allegretto,” “Wall of Nets,” “John Carmack,” “Run For Your Money (Third Take)” and “Kanzo Flip,” showcasing a commanding sense of musical interplay, exploration, chance taking, and tonal presence that pushes the album far out of time constraints of scene or replication. Percussion and bass aren’t the only elements carrying a heavy presence and adding that emotional weight, with the magnetic and spiritual feeling of “Dirty Tape Flip (With Melody)” capturing an entirely different side of Cable’s vision as an artist and instrumentalist. The decomposing and glowing essence of tape reverberates through every tone, shimmering with a special emotion that is truly one of a kind. “Vespia Piaggo” features one of Mexico City's most potent lyricists, Speak, building out landscape after landscape of poetic virtuosity, verbally dashing over vibrating synth pulses, jazz fuelled piano lines, and pocket landing drum lines. Futuristic and advanced levels of hip-hop music that pulls from the ethos of organic rap creators from all generations. The album’s closer, “Indistinct Chattering,” strips away all of the electronics, power and grind of the tracks prior, with Cable playing guitar and bass parts, and also singing an original work that summarizes the totality of the LP’s meaning conceptually and musically.\r\n\r\nWarmed By The Sun was a moment of self realization for Cable just as much as it was an act of expression. Cable reflects on this state of interaction with his art. “I think if anything what has changed for me creatively on this record is that I've come to a full circle realization moment about how and why I want to make art. I don't feel like I'm chasing any trends or trying to sound like any specific style or genre on this record, it's really just an authentic expression of me having fun and exploring my creativity through audio and making compositions. That is something I always look for in artists I sign to the label so it feels good to be in a similar creative space in my own personal journey. I think it's especially important for me to continue to create art and release my work while I run the label because it keeps me directly in touch with the creative process so I can have realistic and meaningful conversations with the artists I work with about their own projects, and come from a place of real life experience and understanding, rather than some cold number crunching business perspective.”\r\n\r\nCable’s last full-length album, Shimmer, Then Disappear, launched in September of 2020, with critical acclaim met by Bandcamp Daily, XLR8R, BBC6, Dancing Astronaut, and more. The album showcased the blueprint for the many forms of music that had been soaked into the fabric of the Dome of Doom label over the last few years and Warmed By The Sun carries that torch further. Launching the decade spanning label compilation Decade of Doom in September of 2021, Cable took an extra year to compose music and tap into a multitude of creative forms during this woodshedding experience. It had been a number of years since Cable had taken off a full-year of releasing music, armed to the teeth with new tracks that became the basis to his most dynamic body of work. Warmed By The Sun drops September 23rd on Dome of Doom and will be available worldwide on digital and limited edition cassette formats.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n\r\n1. Alone\r\n2.
