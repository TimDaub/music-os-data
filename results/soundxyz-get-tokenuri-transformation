It’s a meditation, it’s short bits of me, it’s whatever you want to make it. An opportunity to just allow myself to ride the beat. To create these verses, I would start with a beat I love, rap on it and then send the accapella to Kaui to create something new out of it.\n\n“Culture”, this first offering/verse off of “Joyride” came to me after rapping on Kaytranada’s production. I wrote the verse in a nite and immediately knew I didn’t want to add much else to it. I am very lyrical and I am realizing, sometimes one verse is enough. Sometimes keeping it simple is all you need. Sometimes just riding your own path is what I have to do. \n\nSo this year as I’m riding my path, I guess I’m using this “Joyride” as an exercise in getting back to me, getting out of my way, sticking to my journey, continuing to create with bro Kaui who has been working with me for years, I’m really excited for how this ride will take me to more paths.

It’s a meditation, it’s short bits of me, it’s whatever you want to make it. An opportunity to just allow myself to ride the beat. To create these verses, I would start with a beat I love, rap on it and then send the accapella to Kaui to create something new out of it.\n\n“Culture”, this first offering/verse off of “Joyride” came to me after rapping on Kaytranada’s production. I wrote the verse in a nite and immediately knew I didn’t want to add much else to it. I am very lyrical and I am realizing, sometimes one verse is enough. Sometimes keeping it simple is all you need. Sometimes just riding your own path is what I have to do. \n\nSo this year as I’m riding my path, I guess I’m using this “Joyride” as an exercise in getting back to me, getting out of my way, sticking to my journey, continuing to create with bro Kaui who has been working with me for years, I’m really excited for how this ride will take me to more paths.

It’s a meditation, it’s short bits of me, it’s whatever you want to make it. An opportunity to just allow myself to ride the beat. To create these verses, I would start with a beat I love, rap on it and then send the accapella to Kaui to create something new out of it.\n\n“Culture”, this first offering/verse off of “Joyride” came to me after rapping on Kaytranada’s production. I wrote the verse in a nite and immediately knew I didn’t want to add much else to it. I am very lyrical and I am realizing, sometimes one verse is enough. Sometimes keeping it simple is all you need. Sometimes just riding your own path is what I have to do. \n\nSo this year as I’m riding my path, I guess I’m using this “Joyride” as an exercise in getting back to me, getting out of my way, sticking to my journey, continuing to create with bro Kaui who has been working with me for years, I’m really excited for how this ride will take me to more paths.

It’s a meditation, it’s short bits of me, it’s whatever you want to make it. An opportunity to just allow myself to ride the beat. To create these verses, I would start with a beat I love, rap on it and then send the accapella to Kaui to create something new out of it.\n\n“Culture”, this first offering/verse off of “Joyride” came to me after rapping on Kaytranada’s production. I wrote the verse in a nite and immediately knew I didn’t want to add much else to it. I am very lyrical and I am realizing, sometimes one verse is enough. Sometimes keeping it simple is all you need. Sometimes just riding your own path is what I have to do. \n\nSo this year as I’m riding my path, I guess I’m using this “Joyride” as an exercise in getting back to me, getting out of my way, sticking to my journey, continuing to create with bro Kaui who has been working with me for years, I’m really excited for how this ride will take me to more paths.

They blend elements of dark techno and percussive atonal sounds to create genre bending music that hits you heavy. They set the mood with their seductive vocals and chaotic live shows that leaves the audience shook. They’ve also been known to sacrifice synthesizers with a baseball bat at the end of every show as apart of a live ritual. They are also know for their stunning visual artwork as well as performance art in galleries that they transform into other worldly pop up venues. They also run a DIY lave called ENCHAÎNE MODE @enchaine_mode and just released their first compilation album from various artists they have crossed paths with. \n\nThis project is motivated by the struggles they have had in their personal life. This entity takes on many forms. Being gender fluid/non-binary, they like to explore different feminine and masculine energies within the music. They take on different forms with different characters that represent the energy they are feeling in the present moment. They have manifested into a god like entity that has surfaced from a sort of rebirth that has taken place in their life. This entity has manifested into the armor they need to help them fight battles within themselves so they can continue to evolve. \n\nStreet Fever gained notoriety from acts like Tommy Cash (IG) @tommycashworld performing their most popular track “La Corde” during one of his performances at a festival in Russia as he sang and yelled over the track. They’ve also had notable collabs with Dave Parley of (IG) @prayers Shaun Lopez of Crosses \n(IG) @crossesmusic and are currently working with Russian rap/pop star Tatarka (IG) @smelaya_ira\n\n“Repent” is about forgiveness in a time of chaos not only within this world but within ourselves. This track is a manifestation of the path they have chosen to better themselves in their life. It has moved them into a spiritual, sort of shamanic journey to pull themselves out of the dark and closer to the light. This track is a reminder that there is darkness in all of us and through that darkness we ca find love and light and come together and unify as one. Become what you pray for. \n\nArtwork by Ryan Flowers (IG) @imryanflowers","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/streetfever/repent","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT2cETGoD8d8X6YpGvxeN5Cs2JmiE6a16Z4zjCCDxGYv6","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma5remQ2UQNa2zpJjkwruknj7GWTXZMssGR1uF4tL9TnR","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma5remQ2UQNa2zpJjkwruknj7GWTXZMssGR1uF4tL9TnR","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUwdRJqXENiPsQtdYNumiZsMoLiWECQb9KXXfLfcvsMzA","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Repent","value":"Song Edition"},{"value":"Genesis"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma5remQ2UQNa2zpJjkwruknj7GWTXZMssGR1uF4tL9TnR","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT2cETGoD8d8X6YpGvxeN5Cs2JmiE6a16Z4zjCCDxGYv6","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma5remQ2UQNa2zpJjkwruknj7GWTXZMssGR1uF4tL9TnR","mimetype":"image"}]}

I was born and raised on the South Side with family roots in Ghana, West Africa. Growing up I was a skateboarder first, a graffiti artist second and a rapper third, music quickly becoming the fabric that tied all poles of my life together and gave me contextual meaning. The ethos of my creativity is truth telling; to share my unique perspective through the various mediums I employ.\n\nThe song King Of The Slum was made during my recent stay in Ghana in January. I titled it as such in reference to the slum in which my family resides and my father was born, known as Asokore Zongo in Koforidua. Zongo settlements are largely poverty stricken areas in West African towns comparable in ways to the Black American ghetto, albeit much less resourced. Much of the lyrical content of this song speaks to the juxtaposition of these different sides of my existence. My uncle, who lives in the zongo, is a legendary Ghanian musician named Chief Kofi Sammy of the Okukuseku International Band, and a pioneer of a style of music called High Life. For this record, which I also produced, I took influence from the music of my ancestry while I was physically in my homeland to manipulate some traditional melodic elements within the framework of my own personal style.\n\nThe photograph out of which I made the cover is of myself in the Zongo with my nieces and nephews.

Both of you start sweating buckets and the car is also bunny hopping up and down, side to side.\n\nYou both decide to take off your t-shirts, but when each t-shirt is removed another one is there in its place. This keeps going on and you decide to just keep driving and smoking. You forget about taking off the t-shirts, because there are vampires next to your car chasing you. You have absolutely no way of surviving unless you turn on your hyper thrusters and blast off to the Alamo - somewhere warmer and sunnier. \n\nSomehow it doesn't take that long for both of you to get close to the Alamo. Gas prices are nonexistent in 2050, as cars are mostly urine-powered. The sun comes out when you both arrive at the Alamo and things cool off. You put on hoodies. Everything fades to black.\n\n- The end.\n\nThank you for reading & listening. Hope this song makes you do the dancing and brings you joy.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/joshpan/alamo","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUGkMRFjQVqmsuKbRADLujEyNTe7wGGCoTwFZMQcsEV2H","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfVyucHpwZ7L7L5T5HG6BQ2pu7kQnWf3pP4okLdeosVrb","attributes":[{"trait_type":"ALAMO","value":"Song Edition"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUGkMRFjQVqmsuKbRADLujEyNTe7wGGCoTwFZMQcsEV2H","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","mimetype":"image"}]}

It's a little chaotic, but playful. \n\nGrowing up listening lots of breakbeats and funk, I always envision images of people of the past dancing. \n\nMusic that speaks to you can really evoke memories or fictional stories in your head. Music that really speaks to you might generate a new story each time you listen to it again. I have had so many great conversations with friends about what they see in their heads when they listen to certain songs.\n\nHere's a short summary of a vision I'm seeing now while listening to \"Alamo\":\n\nIt's 2050...\n\nImagine you're with your best friend in a drop top in the desert. You don't recognize your best friend, for some reason, but you know they're your best friend.\n\nSomehow it's getting darker in the sky even though it's in the middle of the day and also getting hotter. Both of you start sweating buckets and the car is also bunny hopping up and down, side to side.\n\nYou both decide to take off your t-shirts, but when each t-shirt is removed another one is there in its place. This keeps going on and you decide to just keep driving and smoking. You forget about taking off the t-shirts, because there are vampires next to your car chasing you. You have absolutely no way of surviving unless you turn on your hyper thrusters and blast off to the Alamo - somewhere warmer and sunnier. \n\nSomehow it doesn't take that long for both of you to get close to the Alamo. Gas prices are nonexistent in 2050, as cars are mostly urine-powered. The sun comes out when you both arrive at the Alamo and things cool off. You put on hoodies. Everything fades to black.\n\n- The end.\n\nThank you for reading & listening.

I really miss putting things out that are fun and feel good. When I started \"Alamo\", I instantly locked myself into the project and let everything out. It's a little chaotic, but playful. \n\nGrowing up listening lots of breakbeats and funk, I always envision images of people of the past dancing. \n\nMusic that speaks to you can really evoke memories or fictional stories in your head. Music that really speaks to you might generate a new story each time you listen to it again. I have had so many great conversations with friends about what they see in their heads when they listen to certain songs.\n\nHere's a short summary of a vision I'm seeing now while listening to \"Alamo\":\n\nIt's 2050...\n\nImagine you're with your best friend in a drop top in the desert. You don't recognize your best friend, for some reason, but you know they're your best friend.\n\nSomehow it's getting darker in the sky even though it's in the middle of the day and also getting hotter. Both of you start sweating buckets and the car is also bunny hopping up and down, side to side.\n\nYou both decide to take off your t-shirts, but when each t-shirt is removed another one is there in its place. This keeps going on and you decide to just keep driving and smoking. You forget about taking off the t-shirts, because there are vampires next to your car chasing you. You have absolutely no way of surviving unless you turn on your hyper thrusters and blast off to the Alamo - somewhere warmer and sunnier. \n\nSomehow it doesn't take that long for both of you to get close to the Alamo. Gas prices are nonexistent in 2050, as cars are mostly urine-powered. The sun comes out when you both arrive at the Alamo and things cool off. You put on hoodies. Everything fades to black.\n\n- The end.\n\nThank you for reading & listening. Hope this song makes you do the dancing and brings you joy.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/joshpan/alamo","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUGkMRFjQVqmsuKbRADLujEyNTe7wGGCoTwFZMQcsEV2H","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfVyucHpwZ7L7L5T5HG6BQ2pu7kQnWf3pP4okLdeosVrb","attributes":[{"trait_type":"ALAMO","value":"Song Edition"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUGkMRFjQVqmsuKbRADLujEyNTe7wGGCoTwFZMQcsEV2H","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSChkYoueCmheD3eSwmZeFGYSwZAiSwyWA5G2QJ5NE8ip","mimetype":"image"}]}

I started making music when I was 9 years old after seeing my dad play guitar. I knew instantly that if I wasn’t gonna make it to the league that I had to make music for the rest of my life. I played in bands in high school and dropped out of college after my freshman year while studying engineering to tour as a drummer/bass player.\n\nI originally moved to LA in 2018 to write/produce songs for other artists. It was cool to start to try to make a living doing in the studio, but I couldn’t help but feel like something was missing. I was working with talented artists, but I wasn’t feeling creatively fulfilled. I called my manager and told him to cancel all of my sessions. I wanted to be an artist and make my own music.  I wanted to exist musically outside the studio.\n\nFast forward a little bit and I was able to release my first music as Alexander 23 in 2019 and was fortunate enough to go on tour with Omar Apollo and Chelsea Cutler that same year. When the pandemic hit in 2020, everything changed, as it did for everyone. Tour was cut short and I went back to LA feeling defeated. That initial isolation brought me back to a time in my own life when everything was going wrong: personally, professionally, romantically. It was that same feeling that something really important was missing.\n\nThis feeling inspired me to write “IDK You Yet” and this song changed my life.

Because of it, I was able to play a virtual festival called Brownies & Lemonade Open Aux which opened up a lot of doors for me. Since then, I’ve played 4 irl festivals, recently got off a US tour with RL Grime, and released with nearly all of my dream labels.\n\nBut even after all of those wins I couldn’t help feeling that something was missing—the magic in releasing music had become foreign to me. After getting involved with web3 and NFTs 12 months ago and observing some of my peers release their first projects, I realized the power of music NFTs and could feel that magic I once felt start to return. The community aspect and supportiveness (from artists and fans alike) in web3 is unlike anything I’ve ever been a part of. I believe that Sound is on the forefront of introducing a much needed shift in the music industry and I’m so excited to be a part of it.\n\nIn 2016 I began my career as a vocalist and found myself drawn to the thought of being able to produce and engineer my own music and vocals. After a year of watching YouTube videos and hiding out in my college dorm room making music, I decided to apply to a music production school called ICON Collective in LA and, within a year, I dropped out of nursing school and drove from Wisconsin to LA to start my music journey. To my surprise, the school only had a handful of women and I quickly learned the struggles of being a woman in a male-dominated industry. Throughout the last 6 years I’ve made it a priority of mine to make sure women are getting the credit they deserve and I’m excited to see a bit of a shift happening in that sense. There are so many incredible women producers, vocalists, engineers, and DJs, especially POC women, in the scene that are getting the recognition they deserve and I hope to see this continue to progress. Crossed Our Hearts is produced, written, recorded, mixed, and mastered by me. It’s just one of a number of self-produced tracks I’ve released but it marks my first music NFT. This song is about moving on from something I once thought was forever.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/paulineherr/crossed-our-hearts","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPZ7UtTz7fkHHroJvaxfzW75ZjR1Xcxb6u9HkMkp8KvAX","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeYYejfu6DXAbvrLQSwSbR2jne2P6VQsHVxsHoqxdpNSo","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Crossed Our Hearts","value":"Song Edition"},{"value":"Genesis"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPZ7UtTz7fkHHroJvaxfzW75ZjR1Xcxb6u9HkMkp8KvAX","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","mimetype":"image"}]}

Because of it, I was able to play a virtual festival called Brownies & Lemonade Open Aux which opened up a lot of doors for me. Since then, I’ve played 4 irl festivals, recently got off a US tour with RL Grime, and released with nearly all of my dream labels.\n\nBut even after all of those wins I couldn’t help feeling that something was missing—the magic in releasing music had become foreign to me. After getting involved with web3 and NFTs 12 months ago and observing some of my peers release their first projects, I realized the power of music NFTs and could feel that magic I once felt start to return. The community aspect and supportiveness (from artists and fans alike) in web3 is unlike anything I’ve ever been a part of. I believe that Sound is on the forefront of introducing a much needed shift in the music industry and I’m so excited to be a part of it.\n\nIn 2016 I began my career as a vocalist and found myself drawn to the thought of being able to produce and engineer my own music and vocals. After a year of watching YouTube videos and hiding out in my college dorm room making music, I decided to apply to a music production school called ICON Collective in LA and, within a year, I dropped out of nursing school and drove from Wisconsin to LA to start my music journey. To my surprise, the school only had a handful of women and I quickly learned the struggles of being a woman in a male-dominated industry. Throughout the last 6 years I’ve made it a priority of mine to make sure women are getting the credit they deserve and I’m excited to see a bit of a shift happening in that sense. There are so many incredible women producers, vocalists, engineers, and DJs, especially POC women, in the scene that are getting the recognition they deserve and I hope to see this continue to progress. Crossed Our Hearts is produced, written, recorded, mixed, and mastered by me. It’s just one of a number of self-produced tracks I’ve released but it marks my first music NFT. This song is about moving on from something I once thought was forever.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/paulineherr/crossed-our-hearts","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPZ7UtTz7fkHHroJvaxfzW75ZjR1Xcxb6u9HkMkp8KvAX","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeYYejfu6DXAbvrLQSwSbR2jne2P6VQsHVxsHoqxdpNSo","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Crossed Our Hearts","value":"Song Edition"},{"value":"Genesis"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPZ7UtTz7fkHHroJvaxfzW75ZjR1Xcxb6u9HkMkp8KvAX","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWoqNH5tf4GuWCNbv1YZ1p5cPSmZaAgo9YqC9GfviVaQx","mimetype":"image"}]}

A lot of time in the entertainment industry, ppl equate your fame level with your quality of life. But most of the ppl I look up to who have what I consider to be a high quality of life aren’t necessarily famous. I’ve found when you keep your wins & happiness private it tends to last longer. \n\nBasically all forces of power I’ve been involved in from management to labels are motivated to keep you ignorant enough about business, but worth it just enough so you keep creating for them. It’s a lot easier and faster to make the most $ off someone's back the more ignorant they are in the traditional industry. I’d say I’ve gotten got in every way possible, from bad deals, stolen ideas, not paid after a sold out tour, etc. But all of that taught me so much about business. I took some of my $ invested in real estate and did some good flips w/ my manager Jay, bought myself outta bad deals and learned how to fund my lifestyle and career completely outside of the traditional industry. Through real estate development and investing, I’m also able to give and hire POC through my businesses and my non profit \"Yebo Life\". \n\nThe meme coins and Wall Street Bets stocks don’t hurt either. In our label, Mogul Sound Music, we want our artists to be as knowledgeable as possible about business and investing because it helps all of us get sharper. The more our artists know, the more they succeed, and the more responsibility they put on themselves to be great.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/allankingdom/reasons","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNb3zUbmCV9fkJnVyapoTrJV68vN4MXVB5WoVqauQnjMG","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVzeN2s3xBWsxChSw7Xq2hKNzUuvtbY6px6M5UAL9e1Fq","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Reasons","value":"Song Edition"},{"value":"Genesis"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNb3zUbmCV9fkJnVyapoTrJV68vN4MXVB5WoVqauQnjMG","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","mimetype":"image"}]}

A lot of time in the entertainment industry, ppl equate your fame level with your quality of life. But most of the ppl I look up to who have what I consider to be a high quality of life aren’t necessarily famous. I’ve found when you keep your wins & happiness private it tends to last longer. \n\nBasically all forces of power I’ve been involved in from management to labels are motivated to keep you ignorant enough about business, but worth it just enough so you keep creating for them. It’s a lot easier and faster to make the most $ off someone's back the more ignorant they are in the traditional industry. I’d say I’ve gotten got in every way possible, from bad deals, stolen ideas, not paid after a sold out tour, etc. But all of that taught me so much about business. I took some of my $ invested in real estate and did some good flips w/ my manager Jay, bought myself outta bad deals and learned how to fund my lifestyle and career completely outside of the traditional industry. Through real estate development and investing, I’m also able to give and hire POC through my businesses and my non profit \"Yebo Life\". \n\nThe meme coins and Wall Street Bets stocks don’t hurt either. In our label, Mogul Sound Music, we want our artists to be as knowledgeable as possible about business and investing because it helps all of us get sharper. The more our artists know, the more they succeed, and the more responsibility they put on themselves to be great.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/allankingdom/reasons","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNb3zUbmCV9fkJnVyapoTrJV68vN4MXVB5WoVqauQnjMG","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVzeN2s3xBWsxChSw7Xq2hKNzUuvtbY6px6M5UAL9e1Fq","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Reasons","value":"Song Edition"},{"value":"Genesis"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNb3zUbmCV9fkJnVyapoTrJV68vN4MXVB5WoVqauQnjMG","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","mimetype":"image"}]}

A lot of time in the entertainment industry, ppl equate your fame level with your quality of life. But most of the ppl I look up to who have what I consider to be a high quality of life aren’t necessarily famous. I’ve found when you keep your wins & happiness private it tends to last longer. \n\nBasically all forces of power I’ve been involved in from management to labels are motivated to keep you ignorant enough about business, but worth it just enough so you keep creating for them. It’s a lot easier and faster to make the most $ off someone's back the more ignorant they are in the traditional industry. I’d say I’ve gotten got in every way possible, from bad deals, stolen ideas, not paid after a sold out tour, etc. But all of that taught me so much about business. I took some of my $ invested in real estate and did some good flips w/ my manager Jay, bought myself outta bad deals and learned how to fund my lifestyle and career completely outside of the traditional industry. Through real estate development and investing, I’m also able to give and hire POC through my businesses and my non profit \"Yebo Life\". \n\nThe meme coins and Wall Street Bets stocks don’t hurt either. In our label, Mogul Sound Music, we want our artists to be as knowledgeable as possible about business and investing because it helps all of us get sharper. The more our artists know, the more they succeed, and the more responsibility they put on themselves to be great.","external_url":"https://www.sound.xyz/allankingdom/reasons","image":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNb3zUbmCV9fkJnVyapoTrJV68vN4MXVB5WoVqauQnjMG","audio_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","animation_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","comment_wall_url":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVzeN2s3xBWsxChSw7Xq2hKNzUuvtbY6px6M5UAL9e1Fq","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Reasons","value":"Song Edition"},{"value":"Genesis"}]}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","mimetype":"audio"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNb3zUbmCV9fkJnVyapoTrJV68vN4MXVB5WoVqauQnjMG","mimetype":"image"},{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://soundxyz.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmThEAFqWbPj9wbjmFZJuXGETdDShntsGMGE6yvL8oySXz","mimetype":"image"}]}

Writing songs is my personal way of keeping a diary. In a time of such chaos and uncertainty, the way that I’ve found to stay sane is to look inwards and tap into the fundamental neural circuitry that we all have. ‘Bliss’ is an exercise in staying true to my own tastes and experiences. The human experience is a constant struggle to achieve a state of bliss. \n\nI naturally gravitate towards experimentation and novelty. The strange filter patterns and sounds of the main synth lines were borne through countless hours of mixing and matching different parameters of different synthesizers.

I had been working in music for nearly a decade, was getting millions of plays on streaming platforms, and had produced a couple songs that landed in the Billboard top 40. But despite having a career many people dream of, by 2016 I was feeling uneasy. My career had started to plateau and my attention was increasingly turning toward topics far afield from music, particularly the existential risks of technology.  To understand the source of my anxiety, it’s necessary to travel back to my childhood. I grew up watching a lot of Star Trek: The Next Generation with my dad. And looking back, the techno-optimist vision of Gene Roddenberry had a big influence on how I viewed human progress. My music tastes followed a similar theme. I vividly remember hearing Daft Punk’s Around The World the first time, and how excited I was when I bought my first synthesizer. This all led to a more serious interest in futurism in college. I started reading books like Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near, and hard science fiction from authors like Stanislaw Lem, from whom I eventually took my DJ name, Gigamesh.  I released music and performed under that alias full time from 2008 onward, growing a modest global fan base. In the first two years, I achieved commercial success and started touring without a management team or agent. This was all possible thanks to the decentralized nature of pre-Spotify music discovery. I would post bootleg remixes and original songs on Soundcloud and send the links to a list of music blogs. The blogs would feed via RSS into aggregators like Hype Machine. There were very few gatekeepers so online music discovery was an organic, beautiful mess. It created a long tail of musicians like myself who wouldn’t have been able to make a living from it years earlier.  Another thing working to my benefit during the early years of my music career was that social media was still in its pre-monetization infancy. During this time, it was relatively easy for motivated, talented artists to cut through the noise and find a niche audience without doing constant self-promotion. Words like “content” and “algorithm” hadn’t become fixtures of every musician’s vocabulary.  By 2015, my career was cruising along at a steady clip but the road was getting bumpy. My old tools for promotion were no longer viable. Spotify had supplanted Soundcloud as the dominant music discovery platform, and Facebook’s advertising revenue model was making it increasingly more difficult to reach my fans, as their attention was now being auctioned to the highest bidder. I found this frustrating, but I wasn’t fully conscious of the impact it was having on my career until much later. Ironically, the algorithms were also turning me into a news junkie with an addiction to political content.  It has taken me years to fully understand what was happening, but my optimism about humanity and technology was transforming into existential dread. The exponential technological progress I previously had religious faith in seemed to be in a doom loop with the master algorithm of unfettered capitalism. After the 2016 election, I was just as convinced technology had the potential to make humanity self-destruct as it did to create vast abundance — possibly more. This realization made it difficult for me to rationalize spending my time making dance music. It was causing instability in both the world and my life. I felt creatively unmoored, which led to spending more time consuming news, which created more anxiety and less musical output.  Nevertheless, I still remained hopeful about technology’s potential for good, which is where cryptocurrency enters the story. In early 2017 I noticed Bitcoin was in the news for having reached a new all time high. I had bought some at the peak of the previous cycle but hadn’t paid any attention to it in the intervening years. Like many people, I thought the ideas behind it were interesting but only had a cursory understanding of the technology and mainly thought of it as a high-risk investment. That all changed when I learned about Ethereum.  Around February of that year, a musician friend named André (RAC) and I started chatting over whatsapp about crypto. At some point, one of us mentioned Ethereum and we were both intrigued. After listening to some podcasts and an interview with Vitalik Buterin, I fell down the rabbit hole. I quickly moved my BTC to ETH, which then proceeded to go up about 10x over the rest of the year. André went even deeper, positioning himself as a leader at the intersection of music and crypto.  By the end of the year, I was starting to think I was a financial genius. It was making me considerably less worried about my music career. Life was pretty good! But then four events conspired to throw my life in turmoil in less than three months: crypto entered a brutal bear market, my manager quit the industry, my touring agency was acquired and subsequently dropped me (along with many other artists), and my wife moved out.  Suffice to say I quickly adopted a much more aerial perspective over my life and concluded I needed to make a big change. Despite the price crash, my conviction in cryptocurrency was unshaken. I thought I might be able to forge a path toward a career in the industry. I had always thought about learning to code, so decided to give it a shot. After going through a free intro course online, I realized coding hit a lot of the same pleasure centers in my brain as making music did, so I kept going.  It was a long transition and unfortunately didn’t save my marriage, but coding did start to make me feel like I could potentially have a higher-leverage impact on the world than what my music skills afforded. After spending about 8 months learning everything I could, I found some freelance web development work. I also volunteered for an organization called RadicalxChange, which has developed a reputation for innovative solutions to the problems in tech I've been concerned about. All of this culminated in landing a full-time role at Left Field Labs, a digital agency that contracts for big tech firms like Google.  While I enjoyed the esteem of contributing code for some of the biggest tech companies in the world, I also had misgivings and remained focused on getting into crypto. By the fall of last year it was clear a new bull market was taking shape, so I decided it was time to make the leap. I quit my job and soon launched a business based on an algorithmic crypto trading strategy I developed in my free time. I called it FinFren. I was able to attract subscribers with minimal promotion, however I primarily viewed it as a side-hustle and was still eager to find a position where I could level-up my skills and feel like I was contributing more directly to the industry. I started applying for jobs.  A few weeks into my search, I dropped a message in the Optimism discord server asking if they needed any front end development help. Like most people invested in the Ethereum ecosystem, I knew Optimism to be one of the most ambitious and anticipated infrastructure projects. I estimated my odds of getting a job there to be pretty low, so I was very happy to get immediate independent replies from both the CEO, Jinglan Wang, and CTO, Karl Floersch. They charmed my socks off and offered me a contract gig for a minor redesign of their website. The contract went well, which eventually led to a full-time position. I had arrived!  Why crypto? Cryptocurrency has helped me regain my faith in the future. Why am I so optimistic about its potential to improve the world? I could go on about this at length, but I’ll try to be brief:  First, I don't believe cryptocurrency by itself will change the world significantly. What I think will have the most impact is something Ethereum has but Bitcoin doesn’t: a Turing-complete virtual machine. It enables an internet of programmable value in which users can easily gain an ownership stake in all the platforms they interact with. My preferred term used to describe all the applications built on this distributed computer is Web3, to contrast with the Web2 internet in which advertisers are the customer, and users are the product.  A common metaphor for the internet is a digital global hive mind. In that framing, every computer represents a synapse, and Web3 is a way of improving the connections between all the synapses. Rather than arbitrary data passing through the network via centrally controlled, rent-seeking intermediaries, smart contracts enable anyone to attach value to their data down to 18 decimal points of precision. This all happens on a network that is massively difficult to hack or shut down.  It should be noted the programmable value isn't purely financial. By managing the complex relationship between incentives, smart contracts also enable the expression of ethical values as well. All of this will enable us to design better social networks and governance systems to conquer coordination failures. In short, Web3 is a better global operating system.  ****************** December 2021 edit: The text above is from a piece I wrote after joining Optimism.io back in February. I definitely recommend following what they’re up to, particularly their work on retroactive public goods funding. I find them to be one of the most inspiring group of builders in web3.

I had been working in music for nearly a decade, was getting millions of plays on streaming platforms, and had produced a couple songs that landed in the Billboard top 40. But despite having a career many people dream of, by 2016 I was feeling uneasy. My career had started to plateau and my attention was increasingly turning toward topics far afield from music, particularly the existential risks of technology.  To understand the source of my anxiety, it’s necessary to travel back to my childhood. I grew up watching a lot of Star Trek: The Next Generation with my dad. And looking back, the techno-optimist vision of Gene Roddenberry had a big influence on how I viewed human progress. My music tastes followed a similar theme. I vividly remember hearing Daft Punk’s Around The World the first time, and how excited I was when I bought my first synthesizer. This all led to a more serious interest in futurism in college. I started reading books like Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near, and hard science fiction from authors like Stanislaw Lem, from whom I eventually took my DJ name, Gigamesh.  I released music and performed under that alias full time from 2008 onward, growing a modest global fan base. In the first two years, I achieved commercial success and started touring without a management team or agent. This was all possible thanks to the decentralized nature of pre-Spotify music discovery. I would post bootleg remixes and original songs on Soundcloud and send the links to a list of music blogs. The blogs would feed via RSS into aggregators like Hype Machine. There were very few gatekeepers so online music discovery was an organic, beautiful mess. It created a long tail of musicians like myself who wouldn’t have been able to make a living from it years earlier.  Another thing working to my benefit during the early years of my music career was that social media was still in its pre-monetization infancy. During this time, it was relatively easy for motivated, talented artists to cut through the noise and find a niche audience without doing constant self-promotion. Words like “content” and “algorithm” hadn’t become fixtures of every musician’s vocabulary.  By 2015, my career was cruising along at a steady clip but the road was getting bumpy. My old tools for promotion were no longer viable. Spotify had supplanted Soundcloud as the dominant music discovery platform, and Facebook’s advertising revenue model was making it increasingly more difficult to reach my fans, as their attention was now being auctioned to the highest bidder. I found this frustrating, but I wasn’t fully conscious of the impact it was having on my career until much later. Ironically, the algorithms were also turning me into a news junkie with an addiction to political content.  It has taken me years to fully understand what was happening, but my optimism about humanity and technology was transforming into existential dread. The exponential technological progress I previously had religious faith in seemed to be in a doom loop with the master algorithm of unfettered capitalism. After the 2016 election, I was just as convinced technology had the potential to make humanity self-destruct as it did to create vast abundance — possibly more.
