The premise of the record was to sculpt a collection of songs where I focused on using vocal chops as both a lead and rhythmic element. In order to keep some sonic continuity throughout the record, every synth on here is from a single device using dozens and dozens of customized patches I made.\r\n\r\nThis song is loaded with laser sounds, collaged vocal chops, jumpy basslines, and shakers I sculpted out of little salt packets. So much of this song is about making due with what you have. I had this one synth I really liked, a bunch of royalty free vocal samples, and a field recorder to make percs with stuff around my house. I loved the idea of seeing just how much stuff I could make with such a limited number of resources. You don't always need tons of equipment and plugins and such to make lots of music, sometimes maximizing what you already have yields the best results. Ideas are ubiquitous - you can find them anywhere at any time.\r\n\r\nThere's a very limited amount of vinyl remaining for this album, and they include a folded 24\" x 24\" poster of the cover art.

Musa became the richest man to ever live, accumulating an estimated net worth of over $400 billion during his reign. However, we rarely hear his name mentioned alongside those of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, John D. Rockefeller, the list goes on…Not only should Mansa Musa’s record breaking wealth be celebrated, but also his contribution to culture, education, and decentralized governance. \n\nMansa Musa Returns, is a visual music NFT, done in collaboration with 3D animator, Illformative. This animation represents the spirit of Mansa Musa, returning to us through the blockchain. \n\nI believe Mansa Musa would be fully onboard with crypto and decentralization if he were alive today. As Mali’s empire grew, Musa arguably created one of the first decentralized ecosystems in the world, when he split up his empire into different territories, granting ruling power to the local chiefs of each region while they all continued to pay tribute to the king. Musa was also well known for generously redistributing his wealth to the people during his historical pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nMansa Musa’s story is also one that carries personal significance, as I myself am named after Sundiata Keita, who also happens to be the original founder of the Mali Empire and Mansa Musa’s great uncle. With Keita being my father’s family name, and knowing this history, I felt called to honor the legacy of Mansa Musa in this way. My intention with this offering, is to ensure that Mansa Musa’s legacy is carried on forever, and that my children’s children’s children will one day feel inspired after viewing this piece. \n\n“Mansa Musa” the song, is also featured on my second album, AfroBang 2: Son of Sogolon, released in 2018 and NBA2K20 selected the song to be featured on their soundtrack, quickly becoming one of the game’s most popular songs. \n\nAnimation \nby iLLformative \n\nOriginal Song\nWritten and performed by Calid B, Limitless, Cheri Soul, and Sleepybrotha\n\nProduced by Lord Haiti with co-production by Calid B.

I put a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself to live up the the high expectations that many have for me, and I felt the need to talk about that in a public setting. In the song I fantasize about what my life would be like had I chosen to go into a more traditional line of work. I highlight that this isn't a pop song and it's more so \"confessions of my lifestyle,\" because things haven't always been pretty for me like the guitar arrangements you hear throughout this piece. To summarize I want to express how grateful and fortunate I am to be able to do what I love everyday and collaborate alongside of people I look up to Like Jeremy Lloyd, Bobby, and Johan Lenox who are the masterminds behind the production in this piece. I would be nowhere without music, but I'd be doing a disservice to myself and many others if I didn't highlight a depiction of the not-so glamorous times I've endured.

This song is kind of the start of me being able think realistically about making music my entire life, living the dream I have known I was supposed to live since I was 11 years old.

It all started on a long walk in search of perspective in my hometown of Newark, NJ . “ I will keep climbing to whatever my heaven is and then there will be a new heaven waiting for me. But, I will have to shed my old habits and mindsets in order to be ready for each new level.” I wanted to communicate this new mindset but I couldn’t find the right beat from any of the homies. So I tried something new , I made the beat myself. It was invigorating knowing that I controlled the entire creative process for myself. You could imagine how fulfilling it was when the NBA and 2KSports both reached out to license the entire song . This song was at the center of a lot of firsts for me. I hope it can be the same for you. \n\n“Burning ladders” is the anthem for one’s inner fight. Whether that fight is to keep pushing , to motivate others , to be a catalyst for growth and change , or just to get you pumped for the gym or sporting event. “Burning Ladders” is a perfect way to express the usually indescribable passion that inhabits the spirits of many. And it slapssss !!! Enjoy the audio cinema known as , Burning Ladders. \n\nWritten & Performed: Desmond Grant Produced by: Desmond Grant","mimeType":"audio/mpeg","name":"Burning Ladders","version":"zora-20210101"}}

Days, weeks, and even a month later, I would still cry about what happened that Christmas Eve. That wasn’t my usual self as I was usually able to “deal “with my emotions in a day or two and keep moving. I didn’t realize I was numb to the emotional abuse for so long, it had finally pierced through the armor I had built up for so long.\n\nI felt weak, broken, low and deeply hurt. But through my healing process, sorting through my emotions and embracing my feelings instead of trying to bury the pain, I found the beautiful things and lessons that would help me grow. The beautiful things that would help me keep my cup full. \n\nAnd so, I began to make the music, write, record and this is what was came forth. \n\nI’ve always believed vulnerability was a strength but now I’m stronger than ever…\n\nI’m gold fanged & floweful just like this visual (lol)\n","mimeType":"video/mp4","name":"Beauty in The Tears - Visualizer","version":"zora-20210101"}}

I didn’t see them as something to dwell on to long. I thought it was just “how life went” and often concluded those traumatic moments as the infamous saying goes “it is what it is”.\r\n\r\nHowever, that emotional breakdown pushed me to not only pursue therapy but it also taught me a lesson in FEELing & properly dealing with my emotions. Days, weeks, and even a month later, I would still cry about what happened that Christmas Eve. That wasn’t my usual self as I was usually able to “deal “with my emotions in a day or two and keep moving. I didn’t realize I was numb to the emotional abuse for so long, it had finally pierced through the armor I had built up for so long.\r\n\r\nI felt weak, broken, low and deeply hurt. But through my healing process, sorting through my emotions and embracing my feelings instead of trying to bury the pain, I found the beautiful things and lessons that would help me grow. The beautiful things that would help me keep my cup full.\r\n\r\nAnd so, I began to make the music, write, record and this is what was came forth.\r\n\r\nI’ve always believed vulnerability was a strength but now I’m stronger than ever…\r\n\r\nI'm gold fanged & flowerful","project":{"artwork":{"info":{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeic6lx547gircpgb3tdcnz2u7qmro3m5fkuybgprhalbg56lkof7x4"},"isNft":false,"nft":null},"notes":"Gold Fangs On Sunday, Reprise is an extension of my 2021 album, Gold Fangs On Sunday.

Following a seven-day coma, Gray died on April 19th; his untimely death and citizen video of his arrest, which showed Gray screaming in pain, prompted both the peaceful protests and headline-grabbing riots. The subsequent two-week police investigation ultimately concluded that Gray’s injury happened sometime during the van’s route – over six stops, with two prisoner checks, and another passenger pick-up. \n\nFreddie was a son and a brother. Freddie's murder sparked riots across Baltimore. \n\nThe collector will receive the .wav file of \"Black Roses\" by Charm Taylor & an all access pass to \"The Power of Spirit: Private Spiritual Self Study Series\" coming soon to web3. \n\n Credits: \n Art direction & music written & performed by Charm Taylor\n Graphic Design: Danielle Miles\n\n\n\n","mimeType":"video/quicktime","name":"Black Roses: Liberation 04:19","version":"zora-20210101"}}

Between Fall 2012 through Winter of 2013, I locked myself up in my bedroom everyday and toiled over recording and mixing songs that would eventually form this new album, “Desire.”\r\n\r\nI really wanted “Desire” to have an eclectic sound to reflect the different sounds I’ve been listening to while recording the album. In particular, I found Bibio’s 2011 album, “Mind Bokeh” an inspiration in terms of eclecticism and wanted to achieve that same level of variety. I also found myself taking inspiration from a lot of my peers on soundcloud who make beats, post-dubstep, chillwave and techno tracks. I knew I wanted my sound to be very “electronic” but I also made it a point to sound warm, organic and imperfect.\r\n\r\nProduction-wise, I’d like to believe that this is my best sounding album yet. It has been a great learning process for me making this album. I found myself learning and re-learning new things in recording, mixing and mastering. I had always admired high production sounds but I also wanted the intimacy of a bedroom-produced album.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the lofi and gritty feel, most of the songs here were recorded in one-go. I also utilized home made percussions and field recordings. Sample sources include old tapes, youtube tutorials and j-pop. All of which were chopped and manipulated then rearranged to be come the backbone on most of these tracks.\r\n\r\nCollaboration was also something I heavily pursued in this album: both musically and visually. I collaborated with Davao City’s (Philippines), Skymarines on “Candy Flavored Lips.” The look and feel of the album, which is a nod to the japanese aesthetic, was courtesy of the talented visual artist Krystal Perez and features Shanghai-based photographer and artist, Mang.\r\n\r\nI did not have any working theme throughout the album but ended up making songs that I feel are somewhat connected to each other. “Desire” is a deeply emotional and personal album for me and I sincerely hope that you find something in here that you connect to. I invite you to listen to it and if you like it, you would pass it along to your friends and loved ones.","title":"Desire"},"title":"Getting to Know You","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x6311dc83848f882d8069375481f438874451a1a8ff4334f92cf11392f99b816670b38a508126ac54df39cb225d5c357afd24181dbf0b5479597da9cfb547ac2a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}}

My objective for that album was to metaphorically introduce you to the rabbit whole of my mind, go down the rabbit hole and before things got too dark, break you back up see the light at the end of the tunnel. \r\n\r\nThis was one of the “on the way down” tracks. The whole album was a cathartic release for me but this song in particular was one of the easier records to write. \r\n\r\nIt’s an expression of SomeDays social distancing (before the Pandemic).  I had been through some hurt in the past via some friendships where people had ghosted me or didn’t want to be accountable for their wrong actions. Being laid off from several jobs throughout the years — not fire but laid off (smh). And even being used by people in the music industry early on in my career. \r\n\r\nThose past experiences made cold and sometimes I would close myself off to the world…and be a hermit. Just because I didn’t want to deal with people. And this song is an expression of that.

Over the next 7 years they experimented with new painting techniques, resulting in the formation of the Cubist movement. Braque is quoted as saying, “We were like mountain-climbers roped together.” They worked closely together to push the other's boundaries and create a bold new artistic vision. \r\n\r\nB-Dos and I met on Discord in 2018 and quickly fell into chatting everyday, sharing demo ideas, tampering with Ableton, and making memes. A digital Braque meets Picasso. \r\n\r\nB-Dos's sound design is a force to reckon with. I remember the first time I heard his song 'Goodbye' it felt like my mind was a scratched CD skipping around inside the Walkman of my consciousness. He does unspeakable things to synthesizers with every release, each time helping take electronic music to terrifying new heights. \r\n\r\nFor 'Frontier' we worked together to make a genre-bender, equal parts music and exploration. I don't think I could re-make half of the sounds in this song again if I spent the rest of my life on it. This release landed us on Spotify's 'Creamy' playlist alongside other electronic music experimenters. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth song on my album Last Chance At Life. Each song is part of a larger story in which three friends leave a ravaged Earth behind in search of a new planet. \r\n\r\nOn 'Frontier' the crew ventures through caves on their new planet in search of carbon-based materials to sustain their future. To read the full story, go here: https://www.houndtrack.com/last-chance-at-life\r\n\r\nEach song on the Last Chance At Life album has its own artwork created by Leonardo Silva (@itwasleo on socials) and mastered by Lukas Turza of Snap Mastering.","project":{"artwork":{"info":{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeiejscp5lead6hbchblgekcbst4iwpmrx3n5hprykaxsemvgfjilom"},"isNft":false,"nft":null},"notes":"Earth is being ravaged by humans' destruction.

It is for sacred nurturing. \nBlack Family Culture is not about race it is about richness.\nBlack Family Culture is not a luxury, it is a necessity.\nBlack Family Culture is lineage, learning and love.\nBlack Family Culture is carried on and created.\nBlack Family Culture is living legacy.\n\nAs my genesis (1st ever) NFT, I have been guided by Spirit to represent something far greater than my music and art. Something so invaluable to me that it is truly hard to put a price on it. But it is the reason why I move how I move:\nMy family. Black Families. Your Family. Every child without a family.\n\nYou are watching the cultivation of a star seed named SōL, (Spirit of Light). Born March 28th, 2017 to a Black father and a Black and Mexican mother. Both SōL's momma and myself, didn't have the perfect blueprint to pull from in respects to our journeys as children and the family culture within our homes. But, we took from the love and lessons we were given and gave ourselves, and shape our own values of Family Culture. This shxt is not always easy but it is surely worth the journey. This is about shifting the world and the cultural narrative of the Black Family. We must remember every person on this earth has the potential to do great things but there are only a few seeds that will bear sweet fruit if grown in unhealthy soil\n\nOpening scene: My mother (SōL's grammy) waving at the camera on the land she grew up on, before we even knew we were pregnant with SōL.\n\nClosing scene: SōL (age 2) leading a short breath-work session.\n\nABOUT SŌL:\nSōL is a sweet and fiery Aries who has come to share, learn, remember and shine. He loves smoothies with baobab powder, singing, acting out movie scenes and playing with cars. SōL has a gentle touch and a very unique sensitivity gift, which we are still unfolding with him. \n\nTHE COLLECTOR(S) +\nWill hold the Genesis drop in the Black Family Culture Blockchain archive!\n90% of funds will go into our Family Fund.\n10% of funds will go to giving families the education, support and creative programs they deserve.

That's usually a time when the grass begins to green & weather starts to warm up. The overall mood changes and flowers that were once fragile tulips begin to grow and blossom. All flowers and plants require a bit of rain to do so, and without the showers they don't grow. I take that as a metaphor for life. We have to embrace the rain, and transitions as we all embark to become the flowers that we're meant to be. It's all apart of the process.\r\n\r\n“ I know I kept it on the low low/but now I’m about to let my soul glow! ”\r\n\r\nAlso this is one of my favorite songs that i've recorded.

To get out of thought.  I was feeling \"loneliness\".   It was created during the sunset of a relationship where you'd much rather talk yourself into the idea that you're over it/have moved on, but knowing you're still caught.  Knowing that the wound is still too fresh for any convincing.  Make music.  \r\n\r\nWe wrote and recorded this in two very, very long days.\r\n\r\nLater mixed by Ben Baptie in England.  \r\n\r\nI have always felt like Oliver knows what's going on with my spirit whether he is conscious of it or not - but there are certain things I've heard him say to me that do not sound like anything a human would say.   Almost, extraterrestrial/spiritual advice that would come from him.  Mind reading.  Which would lead to some of our favorite records.

This song gave me the feeling like I had finally dug a space for myself. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, I moved to Nashville, tn to leave my small town in Massachusetts and pursue music full time. Coming to Music City was both overwhelming and wonderful. I was excited to play in the “big leagues” but was also young and unsure of who I was and of what I wanted to be, which brought some ugly years. \r\n\r\nBy the time November of 2018 rolled around, I felt tired of the music industry and like I’d been chewed up and spit out multiple times already, the way you feel after terrible publishing meetings, bars where people view you as background noise, and where having blonde hair and a Martin guitar meant I wanted to be Taylor Swift. I wrote ‘Coast of Maine’ in a moment where all I wanted to be was back home at my summer house where I felt peace, where I felt grounded, where I knew myself and could trust the love around me. \r\n\r\nCoast of Maine is the song I sing a cappella to open my shows, its the only song of mine I still go back and listen to when I need it, and it’s the moment I remember feeling a shift from being a person with a guitar to feeling like an artist with uniqueness and stories to tell. \r\n\r\nThis song holds such a special place in my heart,\r\nI hope it makes you feel at home !\r\nKR\r\n\r\nWritten by:\r\nKathleen Regan + Jon Aanestad","project":null,"title":"Coast Of Maine","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xd3d68f429bc3c3e04b46116f103e6e07bd9d63af125afe5d02fd6fd77ff32f1412e061167db2dcc2b1d77d3dfbd046e0f190b12c1998055de3694fb1ba54fedd1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}}

This was the song that started my career in the music industry. It now has over 1 million streams across streaming platforms. Spotify (989,151) and SoundCloud (92,000). On the surface, the song is about a sailor who finds solace being alone at sea, free from all of the troubles at home. The underlying meaning meant much more to me than a simple story about a sailor. I used this narrative to express the freedom I felt escaping from an abusive household/parental relationship that caused a lot of pain. After I finally broke ties, I was lost, confused and happy: all at the same time. This was first song I wrote after the dust settled and it has brought me so many places. Whether you connect with Sailor for its beachy vibes and mellow tones, or the underlying narrative/message, I hope you live your life 'happy as can be'.\n\nWritten, Produced, Performed by DEEGAN\n\nLyrics:\nI'm a sailor\nMarching on a wave\nOh I'm a failure\nTryna find his way\nAnd all my best friends\nThey're gonna have to find me\n'Cause on my death bed\nI'll be lost at sea\nHappy as can be\nBe (wow)\nHappy as can be\nBe (wow)\n\nI guess I gotta go back home\nI guess I gotta make my own\nA house made of sticks and stones\nThe roof fell down and it broke my bones\nand I'm at a loss for words, unless they're all absurd\nTake all the sheep who heard when the wind picks up they can fly with the birds\nMy señorita's at home and she's waiting for me\nMake margaritas so we can have fun (whoo)\nShe got lonely at shore while I was at sea \nI traded my phone for the sun \n\nBut when the waves crash down I'll be ok\nI'll find my way back home one day\nAnd when the waves calm down I'm in my space\nAlone at sea at my own pace\n\nI'm a sailor\nMarching on a wave\nOh I'm a failure\nTryna find his way\nAnd all my best friends\nThey're gonna have to find me (find me)\nCause on my death bed\nI'll be lost at sea\nHappy can as be\nBe (wow)\nHappy as can be\nBe (wow)","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"SAILOR by DEEGAN","version":"zora-20210101"}}

(or use it however they please)  ******\r\n\r\nTrack Backstory:  Back before the pandemic wiped out my career, my career was traveling state to state working at hospitals teaching physicians and nurses how to chart electronically.   I would work a few contracts a year, 30 - 90 days in a row, no days off,  which gave me the freedom to come home and have the time and freedom to create with no pressure or distractions.  However, I always want to create so always brought my laptop to work.  One day in 2018, I was outside of the hospital sitting on a bench during my lunch break, and my co-workers came over and asked what I was doing.  I was working on a song from my album, and they said \"oh you make beats?, we want to see you make one from scratch\" so I asked them to the choose the sample,  then created this on laptop speakers in front of six co-workers in 15 minutes.  When I got home from the contract, I put more time into the track, adding more swing to hi-hats, some bass, and a few minor mixdown changes.  However, I accidently opened up a new session,  erasing all the progress I made, so the 15 minute hospital bench version is all that exists..... for now. =)\r\n\r\nI'm very grateful to be releasing this on Catalog Works.  For someone with such an expansive catalog, I've only uploaded one album and a few singles to Streaming sites since 2015 in protest of criminally low artist pay outs per stream.  More than the loss of potential exposure and income, I always feel bad that I don't make my music easily accessible to the majority of people who use those services.  I am a lifetime collector of music, Cassettes, CD, Vinyl, etc.  It feels right being able to add to this special space of collectors, so thank you to all the collectors of art out there.  You are appreciated.\r\n\r\n- Dutchyyy","project":null,"title":"\"No Time to Be Sad\"","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x26180b22f3fe485b22fb82039194ec74cdfb69b52468c945805a130fb04772b861b8b8c74a82d6c1434f6f50f2a89ecf4ad9bcabd90cb7b0ab54d7c390a9dd471c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}}

What does it mean to be able to truly self care when you don’t have access to resources? This idea was put into the spotlight when Covid hit and created a global traumatic experience in which people from all different backgrounds were force to process reality. What does it actually mean to process trauma, grow, and transition in relation to being isolated (finances, socially, culturally, mentally). Video is a loop.\n\nOrange/Yellows as Past\nGreens as Present\nBlues as Future\n\nThe background gradients blend to guide the subject to transition to each section, outfitted with waves as to not trigger trauma and mindful of people who have issues with hallucinations. It can be triggering to see things blur/change subtly and can activate fear of not having a grasp on reality or trusting your perception on reality. The wave lines in the gradients provide a guideline for a sense of control on reality.\n\n1: Warm Gradient: History. Subject is to focus on a traumatic experience they want to process.\n2: Breathing Circle: Stress Reduction. Subject is to follow the guided three breaths as a way to calm before deep processing.\n3: REM Circle: Transformation to memories and REM. Subject is to follow the white circle with their eyes while thinking of the traumatic experience. \n4: Tones: Auditorial processing bilateral stimulation (desensizatation). Second phase in following the white circle, subtle tones and sounds are introduced. \n5: Binaural: Incorporation of the present and blending. Third phase of following the white circle, more binaural sounds are introduced, an auditory replication of Rapid Eye Movement to help support the facilitation of processing trauma and creating new emotional relations with memories.\n6: Fade to Blank: Reset. The subject is able to take a break and sit with the emotions while listening to uniform sounds and patterns.\n7: Gradient to Blue: Closure and Processing. The subject is able to recollect their processing in a calm space.\n8: Hazy blue, calm atmosphere: Collection processing. The subject blends all areas of processing to solidify the new neural connections. Follow the moving line/circle for breathing while listening to a faint melody that associates as a auditory symbol to enforce the changing of the neuroplasticity during this self administered therapy.","mimeType":"video/quicktime","name":"never again","version":"zora-20210101"}}

I would meditate, sing, think, write, connect with nature, and other forms of shadow work.\r\n\r\nThe HeartCycles logo, which can be seen three times in the cover art represents transformation of the heart. Life & love can bring us difficult times, but that energy can always be transmuted to spring forth a new, more uplifting vibration if we look within.

If you didn't know already, I am classically trained, disciplined in 2 different stringed instruments (violin, viola), have professionally sessioned and played keys and drums/percussion in bands and orchestras since I was 15 years old. I grew up not just listening to great and all kinds of music, but playing, writing/composing and bandleading, even across the country before \"AbJo\" was a thing, something I'm pretty proud of, and is a huge part of who I am as a music artist and producer, as well as just who I actually am. This track is an original idea that kinda instrumentally sums up the vibe of this record. With a little help from the homie Alex Dyring on the bass riffing alongside me as I play the keys here, \"the goodfoot cafe\" is at its heart, a big jam sesh, albeit more organized and with the intent of driving a narrative, and this track is the soul of this idea.\r\n\r\nWith this piece, whomsoever holds it will be one of very few who I will give all access to every show date I play \"the goodfoot cafe\" at, acting as a backstage pass I will make official at every venue as a valid ticket, as well as the whole tour package curated from me personally: a signed physical copy of the record, a single piece of each merch item I sell for release of the record and from on tour, a social media post/photo-op with me, co-signed by me publicly and personally, and more. There will be more exclusive drops associated with this record where I'll hook  collectors up with exclusive content, but this is a rare 1/1 teaser of the album at large that you literally won't be able to find anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance to the initial collector, either for believing in my art enough to support me in this way, or for truly appreciating the value of my music and this track enough to bet on it and me to continue reciprocating it right back with more jams from me 🙏🏽...","project":null,"title":"outro gang (\"the goodfoot cafe\")","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x507c8b3ed730ba691b7f9a458817a2cfe3a365a9a6961edb08d5c4cbdd9df85a6badfc51d704cd86acd65edd2c67009eac35efc012d42604cfd7032223269d4d1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}}

The chance of having more opportunities was enough to push them to make the move but in most cases, they didn’t even have a choice.

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: Holly, Dabow, GOD.DAMN.CHAN, Goodnight Cody, and Call Me. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more. \n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s GOD.DAMN.CHAN also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.''  To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.

The Montreux Palace Hotel remained Nabokov’s final home and creative space for the rest of his life.\n\nIf you can ever chance a visit, you will see the Alps rising behind the hotel alongside the lake and sprawling green fields, which are home to the butterflies Nabokov loved to chase and collect.","project":{"artwork":{"info":{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeialmtaeii6jyesbebeyni4duf6d5mhhm7fbgdgyvwexp7bqebxh2u"},"isNft":false,"nft":null},"notes":"Wylie Cable \nLemniscate \nDome of Doom \nReleased: September 20, 2019 \n\nSeptember 20th marks the release of Los Angeles-based musician Wylie Cable’s 7th full-length album, Lemniscate on Dome of Doom Records, the artist founded label started close to a decade ago. The music burns with an unabridged intensity, completely different from his last body of work, Buried At Sea. The unhinged and experimental nature of the label’s ethos shines brightly across the new work, defined through a duality of futuristic progressions in electronic music and past influences forged from a multitude of genres. Many traditional mathematical concepts and references are scattered throughout the song titles and factored into the modeling efforts of the compositions themselves, bridging together the surreal and the measurable; the infinitely unattainable with the tangible. Lemniscate will be pressed in a limited edition run of 100 cassette tapes and will be available on streaming services worldwide. \n\nFeatures and collaborations comprise the bulk of the recordings on Lemniscate, bridging together many minds from the Dome of Doom family: AHEE, Holly, CLYDE, Gangus, and SnakeFoot. Wylie Cable adds further insight on why he selected the musicians found on the new LP, “When I chose people to collaborate with I always want it to be someone who's artistic decisions I already naturally enjoy, that way I don't have to spend time trying to steer the project one direction or another, and you get to let people do what they are most talented at without restraint. All the projects with collaborators on the album went through many stages of change, in most cases starting as an in-person session that we then sent back and forth over and over, kind of like a process of refining and filtering a precious substance.” Every artist is integral to the shape of the whole, blending their personalities and styles with a cohesion that sticks to the surface of the LP’s flow.  \n\nConceptually, Wylie Cable found inspiration for the design of Lemniscate in his obsession with the concept of infinity and its mathematical entanglement with the spiritual concepts of the afterlife and the infinite nature of reincarnation and past selves.  \n\n“In algebraic geometry, a lemniscate is any of several figure-eight or ∞-shaped curves. The word comes from the Latin \"lēmniscātus\" meaning \"decorated with ribbons\", from the Greek λημνίσκος meaning \"ribbons\",  or which alternatively may refer to the wool from which the ribbons were made” - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate \n\nUnlike all the previous works in his catalog, Wylie Cable visualized the concept for Leminscate in one lightning-bolt like experience during a late-night work session. Quickly documenting his vision on a set of note cards as each part of the record revealed itself, Wylie Cable describes the experience in more detail, “I was sitting in my house late at night near the end of last year, probably around 3 am just writing and sketching in my notebooks and brainstorming ideas, then suddenly I was hit with this huge flash of inspiration.  The title for the album, the names of the tracks, the collaborators I wanted to be involved, all sort of suddenly fell in my lap in a moment. I frantically wrote it all down on some note cards I had laying around and the process for making the album started.  This is interesting to me because usually, my process involves making lots of music and then finding what from a collection feels like an album. This was almost the opposite process, where I got the full concept for a record all at once and had to build the parts one by one to fill in the conceptual piece in my mind.  Many song names on the album make references to \"lemniscate\" and the concept of infinity. I think this album is also a reflection on our inevitable death and the cyclical nature of life.” \n \n\nWylie Cable added a number of unique instrumentation across Lemniscate that gives its tonality a bold and fierce magnetism, including this year’s newly released analog synthesizer module from Moog, Sirin, as well as Oberheim’s Viscount Joint Venture, Arturia’s Keystep, the renowned mid-70s vintage synth Octave Kitten, and his late father's Fender Jazz Bass. A fusion of electronic influences spanning the last three decades emerges when listening to the album front to back, speaking the language of Dome of Doom’s creative force. Revered hip-hop artist Jonwayne mixed a large portion of the record, with labelmate Gangus taking on mastering duties. \n\nLemniscate begins with a tremendous jolt of energy, the first song “Aleph (feat. AHEE)” combines ‘90s era Drum & Bass dance floor energy with the forward-leaning beat-centric ethos of LA’s underground music scene. A close friend and labelmate, AHEE is the first collaborator on the album and created all the bass sounds in the track with the Prophet X. Most of the piece was co-written in the studio by both artists, with Wylie lacing the entire piece with a montage of synth melodies and AHEE programming drum rhythms. The song charges through quick rhythm changes and arrives at a haunting quarter-time breakdown, composed later on in the process by Wylie, that explodes with a darkened state of surrealism.  \n\nPortugal’s Holly contributes on the exotic, smoldering, and dynamic pace of “Decorated With Ribbons.” Holly’s raw and intense mixture of sidewinding rhythms and sample chops crystallizes through every measure, balanced by the more meditative and slow-moving sections composed by Wylie that are draped with sitar and vocal contortions. Wylie also recorded live flute performances by MJ Noble at his home studio, layering and composing with the raw recordings the same way someone would rip samples from their favorite jazz record to make new melodies with. These added live recordings help create one of the most peaceful and beautiful sections across the entire album. Wylie Cable and Gangus’ “Oculus Non Vidit” is one of the album’s most powerful pieces, incorporating Middle Eastern scales, syncopated drum patterns influenced by the likes of Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, and quickly shifting sections that feel like a heightened state of controlled chaos. It’s one of the most palatable and universal songs of LP, suited for large speaker systems deep in nature. \n\n\"Mobius Strip,\" a collaboration with United Kingdom’s CLYDE, is a hypnotic and album defining tune that takes the listener through the evolution of their respective sounds and finds a middle ground that feels like new sonic material for both artists. The track revolves around a cyclical yet unmeasurable vocal chant, with deep sub-bass rhythms changing and shifting to create a wide array of feelings and styles in one song. “Wool” features the ever-expanding talents of Snakefoot, calculated and precise in measure cycles, sample variation, and overall structure.  The album’s conclusion is meditatively somber, rich in a drowned array of guitar and analog driven electronics devoid of drums. The guitar samples were recorded by venerable Los Angeles-based musician Kenny Segal and played by Ryan Crosby, a frequent collaborator on many of Segal's productions and songs. Wylie Cable chopped, flipped, reversed, stretched, and further mutilated the recordings into a dream-like sequence meant to evoke the late writer Nabokov sitting in his hotel in Montreux, examining his butterfly collection and knowing that this is his life's final chapter. \n\nLemniscate is an album that finds Wylie Cable turning internal voyages and collaborative efforts into a vortex of sound. A footprint in the search for what else life has to offer after we transition and the memories that we leave behind when charting intersecting paths.  \n\nPurchase/stream Lemniscate here:  https://domeofdoom.lnk.to/Lemniscate\n \nTracklisting: \n\n1.

In a way it is supporting the famous statement that \"an unexamined life is not worth living.\" I was peeling back the layers and revealing alot of ways I was not accepting myself, my reality, or how I felt in general. Often examining our life after spending so much time distracted by our day-to-day can be a lot to take in. \r\n\r\nWhat I found afterwards was a sort of clarity that I never would have felt if I had continued to be afraid of examining what I was feeling. I didn't quite do this on purpose (though I can see it in hindsight) - but the first half of the song is the process of peeling back those layers, examining those intricate feelings. Then it breaks down into stillness, a sobering slowness, only to build back up into a more liberating sound built off of the progress fostered by that self examination. And the very end hints at the possibility that there is something totally new, fresh, and vaguely promising laying ahead after completing this process. \r\n\r\nIt's always made far more sense to me to put these feelings and experiences into music and art rather than strictly talking about them, because I can only tell you so much about what went into making something. There is always endless subtext that I can't put into words. And I always feel enriched to tell a story this way, where you also could've justly interpreted this song in an entirely different manner. I love that possibility and encourage people to decipher their own meaning from anything I make. This is just what was happening when I made it.\r\n\r\nI also designed the cover art, as I do for all of my releases.","project":null,"title":"Inner Inference","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xd970160df4c2076bc2829eb7d17629b68c2e9470b8c36acb2a08aeb2257b0cf94ca60c7fc0b7006edcbe451015754e2803b354e09353e289cf1154fa7fd38e9b1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}}

In a lot of ways things were going well - I was financially comfortable for the first time in my life which was great - but I was creatively stumped. All of my time was going towards $OVERSTIM and it became harder and harder for me to create. For the first time in a while I questioned my love for music.\r\n\r\nTo get out of my own way, I decided to go to Austin to meet up with some friends to do nothing but write and relax (though admittedly, I spent a bit too much time on Discord).\r\n\r\nWe made a bunch of ideas during the trip but none of it really stuck. It was nice having a light hearted approach to music for once but in all honesty, I was a bit bummed that I couldn't leave with a demo to listen back to.\r\n\r\nOn the last night of my stay, I sat down with DLG. to make what I thought would be a quick loop. What started as melody idea at 9PM turned into a race against time to finish the record before my 7AM flight - we were both dancing around the room, pacing back and forth with our shirts off, and matching each other line by line crafting the record. As Dave recorded I kept producing and we somehow managed to get a bounce right before I got to the airport.\r\n\r\nThat night reminded me why music was and continues to be so important to me and I always listen back to this song when I’m feeling detached from art and creativity.  \r\n\r\nArtwork by Nat Goldstein (@artbygoldie)","project":null,"title":"Minuteman (w/ DLG.)","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xe29a44e325d0348e06a8363bdd1c036de83ba3978e5e56b82cd93a2ac8ed74c557eb71442fb34deabd7ac980c7a5b97c12218a3928f29319767aedc694fec2801b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}}

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\r\n\r\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\r\n\r\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\r\n\r\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\r\n\r\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\r\n\r\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\r\n\r\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\r\n\r\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\r\n\r\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes.
