Our music production skills got exponentially better and it became a breeze. We took turns on the same computer. Say SpaceyBlurr did a part for 30 minutes, then Infinati would add to it, repeating the process until we finished an entire collab album. The story behind is contact with aliens, who just so happens to be us.\n\nThis track is called Slippin’, as we went deep into the rabbit hole of music production, with custom synthesis, and experimental bass music.

Written and produced by me during one of the hardest periods of my life, \"If I Have To Ask\" is a record that delves into the doubts I had towards the end of a recent relationship, represented through both the lyrics and the production. \n\nThe story begins with just my voice and a soft guitar, but that light feeling starts to be replaced by more abrasive sounds as the song progresses and I continue to analyze everything that is going wrong with the relationship. Eventually everything begins to spin out of control as I’m forced to face this inevitability head on. By the end, it is full-on chaos with the realization that if I really have to ask if this is true love, I already know the answer.

Her photos have been featured on CBS Sunday Morning with Jane Pauley, Canadian Broadcast News, Washingtonian Magazine, Bethesda Magazine, Shutter Magazine, Michigan Today and on NBC Washington, DC.\n\nShe is winner of the documentary photography category for the 17th Julia Margaret Cameron Award for Women Photographers. On June 18th, she posted this personal story to her Instagram page:\n\n“I had an abortion at the age of 14. It was PRE-Roe and I had to go to another state to have the procedure. The threat of Roe being overturned makes me recall that very frightening time of my life.

To the people most directly affected by this change, my heart is with you. I am inspired by your courage and I am here alongside you.\n\nThe photographs in the cover artwork collage were taken by D.C. based photographer Robin Fader, documenting the demonstrations by activists and allies.\n\nAbout Robin Fader\nRobin Fader is a multi-Emmy award-winning commercial producer and photographer. Her photos have been featured on CBS Sunday Morning with Jane Pauley, Canadian Broadcast News, Washingtonian Magazine, Bethesda Magazine, Shutter Magazine, Michigan Today and on NBC Washington, DC.\n\nShe is winner of the documentary photography category for the 17th Julia Margaret Cameron Award for Women Photographers. On June 18th, she posted this personal story to her Instagram page:\n\n“I had an abortion at the age of 14. It was PRE-Roe and I had to go to another state to have the procedure. The threat of Roe being overturned makes me recall that very frightening time of my life. While I do not remember everything, I do remember being on the operating table and the doctor saying to me just before the lights went out, ‘Shame on you.’\n\nWithout the abortion, life would not have granted me:\n- the most amazing and loving husband and daughter\n- the chance to go to college and graduate school\n- a multi-Emmy award winning and fulfilling career\n- the chance to truly give-back and do what I love most..take photos for non-profits and take to the streets to protest for what I believe in.\n\nToday I give thanks to the people who are boldly taking this message to the streets: ‘Overturn Roe??

I think it’s really cool to be able to use my voice as an instrument in so many different ways.","type":"Single","originalReleaseDate":null,"recordLabel":null,"publisher":null,"upc":null},"isrc":null,"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmUYxWYGCNLHD2vhPhBse3viZcaDrhaTSTGfY5bVhj5BXx","mimeType":"image/jpeg","nft":null},"lyrics":{"text":null,"nft":null},"visualizer":{"uri":null,"mimeType":null,"nft":null},"originalReleaseDate":null,"recordLabel":null,"publisher":null,"credits":[{"name":"Pauline Herr","collaboratorType":"creator"}],"attributes":{"artist":"Pauline Herr","project":null,"bpm":null,"key":null,"genre":null,"recordLabel":null,"license":null}}}
